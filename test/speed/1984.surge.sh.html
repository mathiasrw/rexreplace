			<p class="p noindent" data-line="11">
				<span data-line="11"></span>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were
				striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to
				escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions,
				though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with
				him.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="18">
				<span data-line="18"></span>The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At
				one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to
				the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a
				man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome
				features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the
				best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off
				during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate
				Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a
				varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way.
				On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed
				from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes
				follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it
				ran.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="35">
				<span data-line="35"></span>Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of
				figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came
				from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of
				the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the
				words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called)
				could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over
				to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely
				emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was
				very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt
				razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="49">
				<span data-line="49"></span>Outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world
				looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn
				paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there
				seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered
				everywhere. The blackmoustachio<span data-line="54"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="54"
				></span
				>d face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front
				immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark
				eyes looked deep into Winston<span data-line="57"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="57"
				></span
				>s own. Down at streetlevel another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in
				the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far
				distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a
				bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol,
				snooping into people<span data-line="63"></span>&#39;<span data-line="63"></span>s
				windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="66">
				<span data-line="66"></span>Behind Winston<span data-line="66"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="66"
				></span
				>s back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the
				overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted
				simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper,
				would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of
				vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There
				was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment.
				How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire
				was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But
				at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live —
				did live, from habit that became instinct — in the assumption that every sound you
				made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="83">
				<span data-line="83"></span>Winston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was
				safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the
				Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy
				landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste — this was London, chief
				city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He
				tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had
				always been quite like this. Were there always these vistas of rotting
				nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their
				windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy
				garden walls sagging in all directions? And the bombed sites where the plaster dust
				swirled in the air and the willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the
				places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid
				colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not
				remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux
				occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="104">
				<span data-line="104"></span>The Ministry of Truth — Minitrue, in Newspeak<span
					data-line="104"
				></span
				>*<span data-line="104"></span> — was startlingly different from any other object in
				sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring
				up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston stood it was
				just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three
				slogans of the Party:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="para-block pre-indented"
				data-line="112"
				style="display: block"
			><code>         WAR IS PEACE
         FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
         IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</code></pre>
			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="116">
				<span data-line="116"></span>The Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three
				thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered
				about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size.
				So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of
				Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They were the homes
				of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided.
				The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education,
				and the fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The
				Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which
				was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax,
				Miniluv, and Miniplenty.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="131">
				<span data-line="131"></span>The Ministry of Love was the really frightening one.
				There were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of
				Love, nor within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except
				on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire
				entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even the streets leading
				up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms,
				armed with jointed truncheons.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="141">
				<span data-line="141"></span>Winston turned round abruptly. He had set his features
				into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the
				telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at
				this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that
				there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got
				to be saved for tomorrow<span data-line="147"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="147"
				></span
				>s breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain
				white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese
				rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and
				gulped it down like a dose of medicine.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="154">
				<span data-line="154"></span>Instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out
				of his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had
				the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The next
				moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more
				cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and
				incautiously held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With
				the next he was more successful. He went back to the living-room and sat down at a
				small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took
				out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red
				back and a marbled cover.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="168">
				<span data-line="168"></span>For some reason the telescreen in the living-room was
				in an unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall,
				where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the
				window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now
				sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold
				bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to
				remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard,
				of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It
				was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing
				that he was now about to do.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="181">
				<span data-line="181"></span>But it had also been suggested by the book that he had
				just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy
				paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at
				least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than
				that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy
				quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been
				stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it. Party members were
				supposed not to go into ordinary shops (<span data-line="190"></span>&#8216;dealing
				on the free market&#8217;<span data-line="191"></span>, it was called), but the rule
				was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and
				razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He had given
				a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the
				book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any
				particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with
				nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="201">
				<span data-line="201"></span>The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary.
				This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but
				if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at
				least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into the
				penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument,
				seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some
				difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to
				be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil.
				Actually he was not used to writing by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was
				usual to dictate everything into the speak-write which was of course impossible for
				his present purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a
				second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the decisive
				act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="para-block pre-indented"
				data-line="219"
				style="display: block"
			><code>         April 4th, 1984.</code></pre>
			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="221">
				<span data-line="221"></span>He sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had
				descended upon him. To begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was
				1984. It must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was
				thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never
				possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="229">
				<span data-line="229"></span>For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he
				writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment
				round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the
				Newspeak word doublethink. For the first time the magnitude of what he had
				undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of
				its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present, in which case
				it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it, and his predicament
				would be meaningless.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="240">
				<span data-line="240"></span>For some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The
				telescreen had changed over to strident military music. It was curious that he
				seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have
				forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks past he had
				been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything
				would be needed except courage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had to do
				was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running
				inside his head, literally for years. At this moment, however, even the monologue
				had dried up. Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not
				scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking
				by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him,
				the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight
				booziness caused by the gin.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="258">
				<span data-line="258"></span>Suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only
				imperfectly aware of what he was setting down. His small but childish handwriting
				straggled up and down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even
				its full stops:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="263">
				<span data-line="263"></span>April 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war
				films. One very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the
				Mediterranean. Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim
				away with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the water
				like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights, then he was

				the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank. then
				you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it. there was a

				<span data-line="293"></span>Winston stopped writing, partly because he was
				suffering from cramp. He did not know what had made him pour out this stream of
				rubbish. But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different
				memory had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to
				writing it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had
				suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="302">
				<span data-line="302"></span>It had happened that morning at the Ministry, if
				anything so nebulous could be said to happen.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="305">
				<span data-line="305"></span>It was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records
				Department, where Winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles
				and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in
				preparation for the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of
				the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came
				unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the
				corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction
				Department. Presumably — since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and
				carrying a spanner she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines.
				She was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled
				face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior
				Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just
				tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her
				from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the
				atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general
				clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked nearly all
				women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always the women, and above
				all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers
				of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular
				girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. Once when they
				passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce
				right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even
				crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, it was
				true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which
				had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="339">
				<span data-line="339"></span>The other person was a man named O<span
					data-line="339"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="339"></span>Brien, a member of the Inner Party and holder of
				some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature. A
				momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the
				black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching. O<span data-line="344"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="344"></span>Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck
				and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a
				certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose
				which was curiously disarming — in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. It was
				a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an
				eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox. Winston had seen O<span
					data-line="351"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="351"></span>Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many
				years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the
				contrast between O<span data-line="353"></span>&#39;<span data-line="353"></span
				>Brien<span data-line="353"></span>&#39;<span data-line="353"></span>s urbane manner
				and his prize-fighter<span data-line="354"></span>&#39;<span data-line="354"></span
				>s physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief — or perhaps not
				even a belief, merely a hope — that O<span data-line="356"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="356"
				></span
				>Brien<span data-line="356"></span>&#39;<span data-line="356"></span>s political
				orthodoxy was not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And
				again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply
				intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could
				talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone. Winston had
				never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of
				doing so. At this moment O<span data-line="363"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="363"
				></span
				>Brien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and
				evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was
				over. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away. A small,
				sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them. The
				girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="371">
				<span data-line="371"></span>The next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some
				monstrous machine running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of
				the room. It was a noise that set one<span data-line="374"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="374"
				></span
				>s teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one<span
					data-line="374"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="374"></span>s neck. The Hate had started.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="377">
				<span data-line="377"></span>As usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of
				the People, had flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the
				audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust.
				Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody
				quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the Party, almost on a
				level with Big Brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary
				activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and
				disappeared. The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but
				there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal
				traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party<span data-line="389"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="389"
				></span
				>s purity. All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, acts of
				sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or
				other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the
				sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even — so it was
				occasionally rumoured — in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="397">
				<span data-line="397"></span>Winston<span data-line="397"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="397"
				></span
				>s diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of Goldstein without a
				painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole
				of white hair and a small goatee beard — a clever face, and yet somehow inherently
				despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of
				which a pair of spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the
				voice, too, had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous
				attack upon the doctrines of the Party — an attack so exaggerated and perverse that
				a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to
				fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself,
				might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the
				dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with
				Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of
				assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had
				been betrayed — and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody
				of the habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak
				words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally use in real
				life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which
				Goldstein<span data-line="419"></span>&#39;<span data-line="419"></span>s specious
				claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless
				columns of the Eurasian army — row after row of solid-looking men with
				expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished,
				to be replaced by others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the
				soldiers<span data-line="425"></span>_<span data-line="425"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="425"
				></span>
				boots formed the background to Goldstein<span data-line="425"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="425"
				></span
				>s bleating voice.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="428">
				<span data-line="428"></span>Before the Hate had proceeded for thirty seconds,
				uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the
				room. The self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of
				the Eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even
				the thought of Goldstein produced fear and anger automatically. He was an object of
				hatred more constant than either Eurasia or Eastasia, since when Oceania was at war
				with one of these Powers it was generally at peace with the other. But what was
				strange was that although Goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although
				every day and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in
				newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the
				general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were in spite of all this, his
				influence never seemed to grow less. Always there were fresh dupes waiting to be
				seduced by him. A day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his
				directions were not unmasked by the Thought Police. He was the commander of a vast
				shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of
				the State. The Brotherhood, its name was supposed to be. There were also whispered
				stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which Goldstein was
				the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there. It was a book without
				a title. People referred to it, if at all, simply as the book. But one knew of such
				things only through vague rumours. Neither the Brotherhood nor the book was a
				subject that any ordinary Party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding
				it.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="458">
				<span data-line="458"></span>In its second minute the Hate rose to a frenzy. People
				were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in
				an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The
				little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and
				shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O<span data-line="463"></span
				>&#8216;Brien&#39;s heavy face was flushed. He was sitting very straight in his
				chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to
				the assault of a wave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out
				&#8217;<span data-line="467"></span><em class="em-low1">Swine! Swine! Swine!</em
				><span data-line="467"></span>&#39;<span data-line="467"></span> and suddenly she
				picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It struck
				Goldstein<span data-line="469"></span>&#39;<span data-line="469"></span>s nose and
				bounced off; the voice continued inexorably. In a lucid moment Winston found that he
				was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his
				chair. The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to
				act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within
				thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and
				vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a
				sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric
				current, turning one even against one<span data-line="479"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="479"
				></span
				>s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an
				abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like
				the flame of a blowlamp. Thus, at one moment Winston<span data-line="483"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="483"></span>s hatred was not turned against Goldstein at all,
				but, on the contrary, against Big Brother, the Party, and the Thought Police; and at
				such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole
				guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies. And yet the very next instant he
				was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of Goldstein seemed to
				him to be true. At those moments his secret loathing of Big Brother changed into
				adoration, and Big Brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector,
				standing like a rock against the hordes of Asia, and Goldstein, in spite of his
				isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence,
				seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of
				wrecking the structure of civilization.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="499">
				<span data-line="499"></span>It was even possible, at moments, to switch one<span
					data-line="499"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="499"></span>s hatred this way or that by a voluntary act.
				Suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one<span
					data-line="501"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="501"></span>s head away from the pillow in a nightmare,
				Winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the
				dark-haired girl behind him. Vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his
				mind. He would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon. He would tie her naked to
				a stake and shoot her full of arrows like Saint Sebastian. He would ravish her and
				cut her throat at the moment of climax. Better than before, moreover, he realized
				why it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and
				sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because
				round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm,
				there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="516">
				<span data-line="516"></span>The Hate rose to its climax. The voice of Goldstein had
				become an actual sheep<span data-line="517"></span>&#39;<span data-line="517"></span
				>s bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep. Then the
				sheep-face melted into the figure of a Eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing,
				huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of the
				surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched
				backwards in their seats. But in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from
				everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of Big Brother, black-haired,
				black-moustachio<span data-line="525"></span>&#39;<span data-line="525"></span>d,
				full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen.
				Nobody heard what Big Brother was saying. It was merely a few words of
				encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not
				distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken.
				Then the face of Big Brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the
				Party stood out in bold capitals:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="para-block pre-indented"
				data-line="534"
				style="display: block"
			><code>         WAR IS PEACE
         FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
         IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH</code></pre>
			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="538">
				<span data-line="538"></span>But the face of Big Brother seemed to persist for
				several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on
				everyone<span data-line="540"></span>&#39;<span data-line="540"></span>s eyeballs
				was too vivid to wear off immediately. The little sandy-haired woman had flung
				herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her. With a tremulous murmur
				that sounded like <span data-line="543"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>My Saviour!</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="543"></span> she extended her arms towards the screen. Then
				she buried her face in her hands. It was apparent that she was uttering a prayer.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="547">
				<span data-line="547"></span>At this moment the entire group of people broke into a
				deep, slow, rhythmical chant of <span data-line="548"></span>&#8216;<em
					class="em-low1"
					>B-B! … B-B!</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="548"></span> — over and over again, very slowly, with a
				long pause between the first <span data-line="550"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>B</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="550"></span> and the second-a heavy, murmurous sound,
				somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of
				naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms. For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they
				kept it up. It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming
				emotion. Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but
				still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by
				means of rhythmic noise. Winston<span data-line="557"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="557"
				></span
				>s entrails seemed to grow cold. In the Two Minutes Hate he could not help sharing
				in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of
				<span data-line="560"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">B-B! … B-B!</em>&#8217;<span
					data-line="560"
				></span>
				always filled him with horror. Of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible
				to do otherwise. To dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what
				everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. But there was a space of a
				couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have
				betrayed him. And it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened
				— if, indeed, it did happen.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="569">
				<span data-line="569"></span>Momentarily he caught O<span data-line="569"></span
				>&#8216;Brien&#39;s eye. O&#39;Brien had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles
				and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture.
				But there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took
				to happen Winston knew — yes, he knew! — that O&#39;Brien was thinking the same
				thing as himself. An unmistakable message had passed. It was as though their two
				minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their
				eyes. &#8217;<span data-line="577"></span><em class="em-low1">I am with you,</em
				><span data-line="577"></span>&#39;<span data-line="577"></span> O<span
					data-line="577"

				><em class="em-low1"
					>I know precisely what you are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your
					hatred, your disgust. But don&#39;t worry, I am on your side!</em
				><span data-line="580"></span>&#39;<span data-line="580"></span> And then the flash
				of intelligence was gone, and O<span data-line="581"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="581"
				></span
				>Brien<span data-line="581"></span>&#39;<span data-line="581"></span>s face was as
				inscrutable as everybody else<span data-line="582"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="582"
				></span
				>s.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="584">
				<span data-line="584"></span>That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it
				had happened. Such incidents never had any sequel. All that they did was to keep
				alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of
				the Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all
				— perhaps the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite of the endless
				arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the Brotherhood was not
				simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days not. There was no evidence,
				only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard
				conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls — once, even, when two strangers
				met, a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of
				recognition. It was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything. He had
				gone back to his cubicle without looking at O<span data-line="599"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="599"
				></span
				>Brien again. The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his
				mind. It would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set
				about doing it. For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance,
				and that was the end of the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the
				locked loneliness in which one had to live.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="607">
				<span data-line="607"></span>Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let
				out a belch. The gin was rising from his stomach.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="610">
				<span data-line="610"></span>His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that
				while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic

				<span data-line="630"></span>He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was

				<span data-line="682"></span>He drew in his breath and opened the door. Instantly a
				warm wave of relief flowed through him. A colourless, crushed-looking woman, with
				wispy hair and a lined face, was standing outside.

				<span data-line="687"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Oh, comrade,</em

			<p class="p indent" data-line="692">
				<span data-line="692"></span>It was Mrs Parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same
				floor. (<span data-line="693"></span>&#8216;Mrs_&#8217;<span data-line="693"></span>

				everyone <span data-line="694"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">comrade</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="694"></span>
				— but with some women one used it instinctively.) She was a woman of about thirty,
				but looking much older. One had the impression that there was dust in the creases of
				her face. Winston followed her down the passage. These amateur repair jobs were an
				almost daily irritation. Victory Mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or
				thereabouts, and were falling to pieces. The plaster flaked constantly from ceilings
				and walls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was
				snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed
				down altogether from motives of economy. Repairs, except what you could do for
				yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up
				even the mending of a window-pane for two years.

				>&#39;<span data-line="712"></span>s, and dingy in a different way. Everything had a
				battered, trampled-on look, as though the place had just been visited by some large
				violent animal. Games impedimenta — hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves. a burst football,
				a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out — lay all over the floor, and on the table
				there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books. On the walls were
				scarlet banners of the Youth League and the Spies, and a full-sized poster of Big
				Brother. There was the usual boiled-cabbage smell, common to the whole building, but
				it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which-one knew this at the first
				sniff, though it was hard to say how was the sweat of some person not present at the
				moment. In another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying
				to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen.

				<span data-line="733"></span>She had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the
				middle. The kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water
				which smelt worse than ever of cabbage. Winston knelt down and examined the
				angle-joint of the pipe. He hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which
				was always liable to start him coughing. Mrs Parsons looked on helplessly.

				<span data-line="745"></span>Parsons was Winston<span data-line="745"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="745"></span>s fellow-employee at the Ministry of Truth. He
				was a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms
				— one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on
				the Thought Police, the stability of the Party depended. At thirty-five he had just
				been unwillingly evicted from the Youth League, and before graduating into the Youth
				League he had managed to stay on in the Spies for a year beyond the statutory age.
				At the Ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was
				not required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the Sports Committee
				and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes, spontaneous
				demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary activities generally. He would
				inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an
				appearance at the Community Centre every evening for the past four years. An
				overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of
				his life, followed him about wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he
				had gone.

				<span data-line="765"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Have you got a spanner?</em

			<p class="p indent" data-line="771">
				<span data-line="771"></span>There was a trampling of boots and another blast on the
				comb as the children charged into the living-room. Mrs Parsons brought the spanner.
				Winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had
				blocked up the pipe. He cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from
				the tap and went back into the other room.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="778">
				<span data-line="778"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Up with your hands!</em

				yelled a savage voice.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="780">
				<span data-line="780"></span>A handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up
				from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his
				small sister, about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of
				wood. Both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red
				neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the Spies. Winston raised his hands above his
				head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy<span data-line="787"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="787"></span>s demeanour, that it was not altogether a game.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="789">
				<span data-line="789"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You&#39;re a traitor!</em

				<span data-line="789"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>You&#39;re a thought-criminal! You&#39;re a Eurasian spy! I&#39;ll shoot you,

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="793">
				<span data-line="793"></span>Suddenly they were both leaping round him, shouting
				<span data-line="794"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Traitor!</em>&#8217;<span
					data-line="794"

				and <span data-line="794"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Thought-criminal!</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="794"></span> the little girl imitating her brother in every
				movement. It was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of tiger cubs
				which will soon grow up into man-eaters. There was a sort of calculating ferocity in
				the boy<span data-line="798"></span>&#39;<span data-line="798"></span>s eye, a quite
				evident desire to hit or kick Winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big
				enough to do so. It was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, Winston
				thought.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="816">
				<span data-line="816"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Want to see the hanging! Want to see the hanging!</em

				chanted the little girl, still capering round.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="819">
				<span data-line="819"></span>Some Eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to
				be hanged in the Park that evening, Winston remembered. This happened about once a
				month, and was a popular spectacle. Children always clamoured to be taken to see it.
				He took his leave of Mrs Parsons and made for the door. But he had not gone six
				steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an agonizingly
				painful blow. It was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed into him. He spun
				round just in time to see Mrs Parsons dragging her son back into the doorway while
				the boy pocketed a catapult.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="830">
				<span data-line="830"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Goldstein!</em>&#8217;<span
					data-line="830"
				></span>
				bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. But what most struck Winston was the
				look of helpless fright on the woman<span data-line="832"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="832"
				></span
				>s greyish face.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="834">
				<span data-line="834"></span>Back in the flat he stepped quickly past the telescreen
				and sat down at the table again, still rubbing his neck. The music from the
				telescreen had stopped. Instead, a clipped military voice was reading out, with a
				sort of brutal relish, a description of the armaments of the new Floating Fortress
				which had just been anchored between lceland and the Faroe lslands.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="841">
				<span data-line="841"></span>With those children, he thought, that wretched woman
				must lead a life of terror. Another year, two years, and they would be watching her
				night and day for symptoms of unorthodoxy. Nearly all children nowadays were
				horrible. What was worst of all was that by means of such organizations as the Spies
				they were systematically turned into ungovernable little savages, and yet this
				produced in them no tendency whatever to rebel against the discipline of the Party.
				On the contrary, they adored the Party and everything connected with it. The songs,
				the processions, the banners, the hiking, the drilling with dummy rifles, the
				yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother — it was all a sort of glorious game
				to them. All their ferocity was turned outwards, against the enemies of the State,
				against foreigners, traitors, saboteurs, thought-criminals. It was almost normal for
				people over thirty to be frightened of their own children. And with good reason, for
				hardly a week passed in which The Times did not carry a paragraph describing how
				some eavesdropping little sneak — <span data-line="859"></span>&#8216;<em
					class="em-low1"
					>child hero</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="859"></span> was the phrase generally used — had overheard
				some compromising remark and denounced its parents to the Thought Police.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="863">
				<span data-line="863"></span>The sting of the catapult bullet had worn off. He
				picked up his pen half-heartedly, wondering whether he could find something more to
				write in the diary. Suddenly he began thinking of O<span data-line="866"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="866"></span>Brien again.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="868">
				<span data-line="868"></span>Years ago — how long was it? Seven years it must be —
				he had dreamed that he was walking through a pitch-dark room. And someone sitting to
				one side of him had said as he passed: <span data-line="870"></span>&#8216;<em
					class="em-low1"
					>We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="871"></span> It was said very quietly, almost casually — a
				statement, not a command. He had walked on without pausing. What was curious was
				that at the time, in the dream, the words had not made much impression on him. It
				was only later and by degrees that they had seemed to take on significance. He could
				not now remember whether it was before or after having the dream that he had seen
				O<span data-line="878"></span>&#39;<span data-line="878"></span>Brien for the first
				time, nor could he remember when he had first identified the voice as O<span
					data-line="879"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="879"></span>Brien<span data-line="879"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="879"
				></span
				>s. But at any rate the identification existed. It was O<span data-line="880"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="880"></span>Brien who had spoken to him out of the dark.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="883">
				<span data-line="883"></span>Winston had never been able to feel sure — even after
				this morning<span data-line="884"></span>&#39;<span data-line="884"></span>s flash
				of the eyes it was still impossible to be sure whether O<span data-line="885"></span
				>&#8216;Brien was a friend or an enemy. Nor did it even seem to matter greatly.
				There was a link of understanding between them, more important than affection or
				partisanship. &#8217;<span data-line="888"></span
				><em class="em-low1">We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,</em
				><span data-line="888"></span>&#39;<span data-line="888"></span> he had said.
				Winston did not know what it meant, only that in some way or another it would come
				true.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="892">
				<span data-line="892"></span>The voice from the telescreen paused. A trumpet call,
				clear and beautiful, floated into the stagnant air. The voice continued raspingly:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="896">
				<span data-line="896"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Attention! Your attention, please! A newsflash has this moment arrived from the
					Malabar front. Our forces in South India have won a glorious victory. I am
					authorized to say that the action we are now reporting may well bring the war
					within measurable distance of its end. Here is the newsflash -</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="900"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="902">
				<span data-line="902"></span>Bad news coming, thought Winston. And sure enough,
				following on a gory description of the annihilation of a Eurasian army, with
				stupendous figures of killed and prisoners, came the announcement that, as from next
				week, the chocolate ration would be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="908">
				<span data-line="908"></span>Winston belched again. The gin was wearing off, leaving
				a deflated feeling. The telescreen — perhaps to celebrate the victory, perhaps to
				drown the memory of the lost chocolate — crashed into
				<span data-line="911"></span>&#8216;_Oceania, &#8217;<span data-line="911"></span
				>_<span data-line="911"></span>tis for thee<span data-line="911"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="911"
				></span
				>. You were supposed to stand to attention. However, in his present position he was
				invisible.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="915">
				<span data-line="915"></span>&#8216;_Oceania, &#8217;<span data-line="915"></span
				><em class="em-low1">tis for thee</em><span data-line="915"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="915"
				></span>
				gave way to lighter music. Winston walked over to the window, keeping his back to
				the telescreen. The day was still cold and clear. Somewhere far away a rocket bomb
				exploded with a dull, reverberating roar. About twenty or thirty of them a week were
				falling on London at present.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="922">
				<span data-line="922"></span>Down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to
				and fro, and the word INGSOC fitfully appeared and vanished. Ingsoc. The sacred
				principles of Ingsoc. Newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past. He felt as
				though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world
				where he himself was the monster. He was alone. The past was dead, the future was
				unimaginable. What certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on
				his side? And what way of knowing that the dominion of the Party would not endure
				for ever? Like an answer, the three slogans on the white face of the Ministry of
				Truth came back to him:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="para-block pre-indented"
				data-line="934"
				style="display: block"
			><code>         WAR IS PEACE
         FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
         IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
         </code></pre>
			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="939">
				<span data-line="939"></span>He took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket.
				There, too, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the
				other face of the coin the head of Big Brother. Even from the coin the eyes pursued
				you. On coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on the
				wrappings of a cigarette Packet — everywhere. Always the eyes watching you and the
				voice enveloping you. Asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors,
				in the bath or in bed — no escape. Nothing was your own except the few cubic
				centimetres inside your skull.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="950">
				<span data-line="950"></span>The sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of
				the Ministry of Truth, with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the
				loopholes of a fortress. His heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape. It
				was too strong, it could not be stormed. A thousand rocket bombs would not batter it
				down. He wondered again for whom he was writing the diary. For the future, for the
				past — for an age that might be imaginary. And in front of him there lay not death
				but annihilation. The diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour. Only
				the Thought Police would read what he had written, before they wiped it out of
				existence and out of memory. How could you make appeal to the future when not a
				trace of you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could
				physically survive?
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="965">
				<span data-line="965"></span>The telescreen struck fourteen. He must leave in ten
				minutes. He had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="968">
				<span data-line="968"></span>Curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put
				new heart into him. He was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever
				hear. But so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not
				broken. It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on
				the human heritage. He went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="976">
				<span data-line="976"></span>To the future or to the past, to a time when thought is
				free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone — to a time when
				truth exists and what is done cannot be undone:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="981">
				<span data-line="981"></span>From the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude,
				from the age of Big Brother, from the age of doublethink — greetings!
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="985">
				<span data-line="985"></span>He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him
				that it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that
				he had taken the decisive step. The consequences of every act are included in the
				act itself. He wrote:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="990">
				<span data-line="990"></span>Thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime IS
				death.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="993">
				<span data-line="993"></span>Now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became
				important to stay alive as long as possible. Two fingers of his right hand were
				inkstained. It was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you. Some nosing
				zealot in the Ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-haired
				woman or the dark-haired girl from the Fiction Department) might start wondering why
				he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he had used an old-fashioned pen,
				what he had been writing — and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter. He went
				to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap
				which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this
				purpose.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1006">
				<span data-line="1006"></span>He put the diary away in the drawer. It was quite
				useless to think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its
				existence had been discovered. A hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious.
				With the tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and
				deposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shaken off if the
				book was moved.

			<p class="p noindent" data-line="1016">
				<span data-line="1016"></span>Winston was dreaming of his mother.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1018">
				<span data-line="1018"></span>He must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old
				when his mother had disappeared. She was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman
				with slow movements and magnificent fair hair. His father he remembered more vaguely
				as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (Winston remembered especially
				the very thin soles of his father<span data-line="1023"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="1023"

				up in one of the first great purges of the fifties.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1027">
				<span data-line="1027"></span>At this moment his mother was sitting in some place
				deep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms. He did not remember his
				sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful
				eyes. Both of them were looking up at him. They were down in some subterranean place
				— the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave — but it was a place
				which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards. They were in the saloon
				of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water. There was still
				air in the saloon, they could still see him and he them, but all the while they were
				sinking down, down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from
				sight for ever. He was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to
				death, and they were down there because he was up here. He knew it and they knew it,
				and he could see the knowledge in their faces. There was no reproach either in their
				faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he
				might remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1047">
				<span data-line="1047"></span>He could not remember what had happened, but he knew
				in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been
				sacrificed to his own. It was one of those dreams which, while retaining the
				characteristic dream scenery, are a continuation of one<span data-line="1051"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="1051"></span>s intellectual life, and in which one becomes
				aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake. The
				thing that now suddenly struck Winston was that his mother<span
					data-line="1054"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="1054"></span>s death, nearly thirty years ago, had been
				tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible. Tragedy, he perceived,
				belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and
				friendship, and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to
				know the reason. His mother<span data-line="1059"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="1059"
				></span
				>s memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him, when he was too young
				and selfish to love her in return, and because somehow, he did not remember how, she
				had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable.
				Such things, he saw, could not happen today. Today there were fear, hatred, and
				pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows. All this he seemed to
				see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him through the
				green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1070">
				<span data-line="1070"></span>Suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a
				summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground. The landscape
				that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully
				certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world. In his waking thoughts he
				called it the Golden Country. It was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a
				foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on
				the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly
				in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women<span
					data-line="1079"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="1079"></span>s hair. Somewhere near at hand, though out of
				sight, there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools
				under the willow trees.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1084">
				<span data-line="1084"></span>The girl with dark hair was coming towards them across
				the field. With what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung
				them disdainfully aside. Her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in
				him, indeed he barely looked at it. What overwhelmed him in that instant was
				admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside. With its
				grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system of
				thought, as though Big Brother and the Party and the Thought Police could all be
				swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm. That too was a
				gesture belonging to the ancient time. Winston woke up with the word
				<span data-line="1095"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Shakespeare</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="1095"></span>
				on his lips.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1097">
				<span data-line="1097"></span>The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting
				whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds. It was nought seven
				fifteen, getting-up time for office workers. Winston wrenched his body out of bed —
				naked, for a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons
				annually, and a suit of pyjamas was 600 — and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of
				shorts that were lying across a chair. The Physical Jerks would begin in three
				minutes. The next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly
				always attacked him soon after waking up. It emptied his lungs so completely that he
				could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep
				gasps. His veins had swelled with the effort of the cough, and the varicose ulcer
				had started itching.

				<span data-line="1116"></span>Winston sprang to attention in front of the

			<p class="p indent" data-line="1126">
				<span data-line="1126"></span>The pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out
				of Winston<span data-line="1127"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1127"></span>s mind
				the impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise
				restored it somewhat. As he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing on
				his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the Physical
				Jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early
				childhood. It was extraordinarily difficult. Beyond the late fifties everything
				faded. When there were no external records that you could refer to, even the outline
				of your own life lost its sharpness. You remembered huge events which had quite
				probably not happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to
				recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you could
				assign nothing. Everything had been different then. Even the names of countries, and
				their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had not
				been so called in those days: it had been called England or Britain, though London,
				he felt fairly certain, had always been called London.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1146">
				<span data-line="1146"></span>Winston could not definitely remember a time when his
				country had not been at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long
				interval of peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an
				air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise. Perhaps it was the time when
				the atomic bomb had fallen on Colchester. He did not remember the raid itself, but
				he did remember his father<span data-line="1152"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="1152"
				></span
				>s hand clutching his own as they hurried down, down, down into some place deep in
				the earth, round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which
				finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest.
				His mother, in her slow, dreamy way, was following a long way behind them. She was
				carrying his baby sister — or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was
				carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been born then. Finally they had
				emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be a Tube station.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1164">
				<span data-line="1164"></span>There were people sitting all over the stone-flagged
				floor, and other people, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one
				above the other. Winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the
				floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a
				bunk. The old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from
				very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears. He
				reeked of gin. It seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, and one could
				have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin. But though slightly
				drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable. In his
				childish way Winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond
				forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened. It also seemed to him
				that he knew what it was. Someone whom the old man loved — a little granddaughter,
				perhaps had been killed. Every few minutes the old man kept repeating:

					>We didn&#39;t ought to &#39;ave trusted &#39;em. I said so, Ma, didn&#39;t I?

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1190">
				<span data-line="1190"></span>Since about that time, war had been literally
				continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war. For
				several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in
				London itself, some of which he remembered vividly. But to trace out the history of
				the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been
				utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention
				of any other alignment than the existing one. At this moment, for example, in 1984
				(if it was 1984), Oceania was at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. In
				no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any
				time been grouped along different lines. Actually, as Winston well knew, it was only
				four years since Oceania had been at war with Eastasia and in alliance with Eurasia.
				But that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess
				because his memory was not satisfactorily under control. Officially the change of
				partners had never happened. Oceania was at war with Eurasia: therefore Oceania had
				always been at war with Eurasia. The enemy of the moment always represented absolute
				evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1213">
				<span data-line="1213"></span>The frightening thing, he reflected for the ten
				thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips,
				they were gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be
				good for the back muscles) — the frightening thing was that it might all be true. If
				the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it
				never happened — that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death?
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1222">
				<span data-line="1222"></span>The Party said that Oceania had never been in alliance
				with Eurasia. He, Winston Smith, knew that Oceania had been in alliance with Eurasia
				as short a time as four years ago. But where did that knowledge exist? Only in his
				own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. And if all others
				accepted the lie which the Party imposed<span data-line="1227"></span>
				<span data-line="1227"></span>-if all records told the same tale — then the lie
				passed into history and became truth. <span data-line="1229"></span>&#8216;<em

					>controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="1230"></span> And yet the past, though of its nature
				alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting
				to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of
				victories over your own memory. <span data-line="1234"></span>&#8216;_Reality

			<p class="p indent" data-line="1240">
				<span data-line="1240"></span>Winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled
				his lungs with air. His mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink.
				To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling
				carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out,
				knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against
				logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was
				impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it
				was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when
				it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the
				same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to
				induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of
				hypnosis you had just performed. Even to understand the word
				<span data-line="1255"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">doublethink</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="1255"></span>
				involved the use of doublethink.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="1258">
				<span data-line="1258"></span>The instructress had called them to attention again.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="1263">
				<span data-line="1263"></span>Winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting
				pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on
				another coughing fit. The half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations. The
				past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed. For
				how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record
				outside your own memory? He tried to remember in what year he had first heard
				mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties,
				but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother
				figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days.
				His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended
				into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in
				their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London in great
				gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides. There was no knowing how
				much of this legend was true and how much invented. Winston could not even remember
				at what date the Party itself had come into existence. He did not believe he had
				ever heard the word Ingsoc before 1960, but it was possible that in its Oldspeak
				form-<span data-line="1284"></span>&#8216;English Socialism&#8217;<span
					data-line="1284"
				></span
				>, that is to say — it had been current earlier. Everything melted into mist.
				Sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie. It was not true, for
				example, as was claimed in the Party history books, that the Party had invented
				aeroplanes. He remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood. But you could
				prove nothing. There was never any evidence. Just once in his whole life he had held
				in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical
				fact. And on that occasion

				>&#39;<span data-line="1326"></span>s work started, Winston pulled the speakwrite
				towards him, blew the dust from its mouthpiece, and put on his spectacles. Then he
				unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already
				flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1332">
				<span data-line="1332"></span>In the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices.
				To the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the
				left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of
				Winston<span data-line="1335"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1335"></span>s arm, a
				large oblong slit protected by a wire grating. This last was for the disposal of
				waste paper. Similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the
				building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor. For some
				reason they were nicknamed memory holes. When one knew that any document was due for
				destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an
				automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in,
				whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces
				which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1348">
				<span data-line="1348"></span>Winston examined the four slips of paper which he had
				unrolled. Each contained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviated
				jargon — not actually Newspeak, but consisting largely of Newspeak words — which was
				used in the Ministry for internal purposes. They ran:
			</p>
			<pre

			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="1359">
				<span data-line="1359"></span>With a faint feeling of satisfaction Winston laid the
				fourth message aside. It was an intricate and responsible job and had better be
				dealt with last. The other three were routine matters, though the second one would
				probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1365">
				<span data-line="1365"></span>Winston dialled
				<span data-line="1365"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">back numbers</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="1365"></span> on the telescreen and called for the
				appropriate issues of The Times, which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a
				few minutes<span data-line="1367"></span>_<span data-line="1367"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="1367"

				delay. The messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one
				reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had
				it, to rectify. For example, it appeared from The Times of the seventeenth of March
				that Big Brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the South
				Indian front would remain quiet but that a Eurasian offensive would shortly be
				launched in North Africa. As it happened, the Eurasian Higher Command had launched
				its offensive in South India and left North Africa alone. It was therefore necessary
				to rewrite a paragraph of Big Brother<span data-line="1378"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="1378"
				></span
				>s speech, in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually
				happened. Or again, The Times of the nineteenth of December had published the
				official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the
				fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year
				Plan. Today<span data-line="1383"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1383"></span>s issue
				contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the
				forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong. Winston<span data-line="1385"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="1385"></span>s job was to rectify the original figures by
				making them agree with the later ones. As for the third message, it referred to a
				very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes. As short a time
				ago as February, the Ministry of Plenty had issued a promise (a
				<span data-line="1390"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">categorical pledge</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="1390"></span> were the official words) that there would be
				no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984. Actually, as Winston was aware,
				the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of
				the present week. All that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a
				warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in
				April.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1398">
				<span data-line="1398"></span>As soon as Winston had dealt with each of the
				messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of The
				Times and pushed them into the pneumatic tube. Then, with a movement which was as
				nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes
				that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by
				the flames.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1406">
				<span data-line="1406"></span>What happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the
				pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms. As
				soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number
				of The Times had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the
				original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead.
				This process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to
				books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons,
				photographs — to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably
				hold any political or ideological significance. Day by day and almost minute by
				minute the past was brought up to date. In this way every prediction made by the
				Party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was any item
				of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the
				moment, ever allowed to remain on record. All history was a palimpsest, scraped
				clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary. In no case would it have
				been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken
				place. The largest section of the Records Department, far larger than the one on
				which Winston worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down
				and collect all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been
				superseded and were due for destruction. A number of The Times which might, because
				of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by Big Brother,
				have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original
				date, and no other copy existed to contradict it. Books, also, were recalled and
				rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued without any admission that
				any alteration had been made. Even the written instructions which Winston received,
				and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated
				or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to
				slips, errors, misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in
				the interests of accuracy.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1444">
				<span data-line="1444"></span>But actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the
				Ministry of Plenty<span data-line="1445"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1445"></span>s
				figures, it was not even forgery. It was merely the substitution of one piece of
				nonsense for another. Most of the material that you were dealing with had no
				connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is
				contained in a direct lie. Statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original
				version as in their rectified version. A great deal of the time you were expected to
				make them up out of your head. For example, the Ministry of Plenty<span
					data-line="1452"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="1452"></span>s forecast had estimated the output of boots for
				the quarter at 145 million pairs. The actual output was given as sixty-two millions.
				Winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven
				millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled.
				In any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions,
				or than 145 millions. Very likely no boots had been produced at all. Likelier still,
				nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared. All one knew was that every
				quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the
				population of Oceania went barefoot. And so it was with every class of recorded
				fact, great or small. Everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally,
				even the date of the year had become uncertain.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1468">
				<span data-line="1468"></span>Winston glanced across the hall. In the corresponding
				cubicle on the other side a small, precise-looking, dark- chinned man named
				Tillotson was working steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his
				mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite. He had the air of trying to
				keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen. He looked up,
				and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in Winston<span data-line="1475"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="1475"></span>s direction.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1477">
				<span data-line="1477"></span>Winston hardly knew Tillotson, and had no idea what
				work he was employed on. People in the Records Department did not readily talk about
				their jobs. In the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its
				endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were
				quite a dozen people whom Winston did not even know by name, though he daily saw
				them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the Two Minutes Hate.
				He knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day
				in day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from the Press the names of people
				who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed. There
				was a certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of
				years earlier. And a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy creature named
				Ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes
				and metres, was engaged in producing garbled versions — definitive texts, they were
				called — of poems which had become ideologically offensive, but which for one reason
				or another were to be retained in the anthologies. And this hall, with its fifty
				workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the
				huge complexity of the Records Department. Beyond, above, below, were other swarms
				of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs. There were the huge
				printing-shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts, and their
				elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs. There was the
				tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and its teams of actors
				specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices. There were the armies of
				reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals
				which were due for recall. There were the vast repositories where the corrected
				documents were stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were
				destroyed. And somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains
				who co-ordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it
				necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified,
				and the other rubbed out of existence.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1516">
				<span data-line="1516"></span>And the Records Department, after all, was itself only
				a single branch of the Ministry of Truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct
				the past but to supply the citizens of Oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks,
				telescreen programmes, plays, novels — with every conceivable kind of information,
				instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan, from a lyric poem to a
				biological treatise, and from a child<span data-line="1523"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="1523"
				></span
				>s spelling-book to a Newspeak dictionary. And the Ministry had not only to supply
				the multifarious needs of the party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a
				lower level for the benefit of the proletariat. There was a whole chain of separate
				departments dealing with proletarian literature,
			</p>
			<pre

    rubbishy  newspapers  containing  almost  nothing except sport,
    crime and astrology, sensational  five-cent  novelettes,  films
    oozing  with  sex,  and  sentimental  songs which were composed
    entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of  kaleidoscope
    known  as a versificator. There was even a whole sub-section —

			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="1540">
				<span data-line="1540"></span>Three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube
				while Winston was working, but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them
				before the Two Minutes Hate interrupted him. When the Hate was over he returned to
				his cubicle, took the Newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed the speakwrite to
				one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his main job of the morning.

				<span data-line="1548"></span>Winston<span data-line="1548"></span>&#39;<span

				included in it there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose

				principles of Ingsoc and your estimate of what the Party wanted you to say. Winston
				was good at this kind of thing. On occasion he had even been entrusted with the

			<p class="p indent" data-line="1570">
				<span data-line="1570"></span>Winston read through the offending article. Big
				Brother<span data-line="1570"></span>&#39;<span data-line="1570"></span>s Order for
				the Day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization
				known as FFCC, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the
				Floating Fortresses. A certain Comrade Withers, a prominent member of the Inner
				Party, had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration, the Order
				of Conspicuous Merit, Second Class.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1579">
				<span data-line="1579"></span>Three months later FFCC had suddenly been dissolved
				with no reasons given. One could assume that Withers and his associates were now in
				disgrace, but there had been no report of the matter in the Press or on the
				telescreen. That was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to
				be put on trial or even publicly denounced. The great purges involving thousands of
				people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals who made abject
				confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed, were special show-pieces
				not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years. More commonly, people who had
				incurred the displeasure of the Party simply disappeared and were never heard of
				again. One never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them. In some
				cases they might not even be dead. Perhaps thirty people personally known to
				Winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1596">
				<span data-line="1596"></span>Winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip. In
				the cubicle across the way Comrade Tillotson was still crouching secretively over
				his speakwrite. He raised his head for a moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash.
				Winston wondered whether Comrade Tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself.
				It was perfectly possible. So tricky a piece of work would never be entrusted to a
				single person: on the other hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to admit
				openly that an act of fabrication was taking place. Very likely as many as a dozen
				people were now working away on rival versions of what Big Brother had actually
				said. And presently some master brain in the Inner Party would select this version
				or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processes of
				cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie would pass into
				the permanent records and become truth.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1612">
				<span data-line="1612"></span>Winston did not know why Withers had been disgraced.
				Perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence. Perhaps Big Brother was merely
				getting rid of a too-popular subordinate. Perhaps Withers or someone close to him
				had been suspected of heretical tendencies. Or perhaps — what was likeliest of all —
				the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part
				of the mechanics of government. The only real clue lay in the words
				<span data-line="1619"></span>&#8216;_refs unpersons&#8217;<span
					data-line="1620"
				></span
				>, which indicated that Withers was already dead. You could not invariably assume
				this to be the case when people were arrested. Sometimes they were released and
				allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being
				executed. Very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would
				make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds
				of others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever. Withers, however,
				was already an unperson. He did not exist: he had never existed. Winston decided
				that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of Big Brother<span
					data-line="1630"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="1630"></span>s speech. It was better to make it deal with
				something totally unconnected with its original subject.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1634">
				<span data-line="1634"></span>He might turn the speech into the usual denunciation
				of traitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to
				invent a victory at the front, or some triumph of over-production in the Ninth
				Three-Year Plan, might complicate the records too much. What was needed was a piece
				of pure fantasy. Suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready made as it were, the
				image of a certain Comrade Ogilvy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic
				circumstances. There were occasions when Big Brother devoted his Order for the Day
				to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file Party member whose life and death he
				held up as an example worthy to be followed. Today he should commemorate Comrade
				Ogilvy. It was true that there was no such person as Comrade Ogilvy, but a few lines
				of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1650">
				<span data-line="1650"></span>Winston thought for a moment, then pulled the
				speakwrite towards him and began dictating in Big Brother<span
					data-line="1651"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="1651"></span>s familiar style: a style at once military and
				pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering
				them (<span data-line="1654"></span>&#8216;What lessons do we learn from this fact,
				comrades? The lesson — which is also one of the fundamental principles of Ingsoc —
				that,_&#8217;<span data-line="1656"></span> etc., etc.), easy to imitate.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1658">
				<span data-line="1658"></span>At the age of three Comrade Ogilvy had refused all
				toys except a drum, a sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter. At six — a year
				early, by a special relaxation of the rules — he had joined the Spies, at nine he
				had been a troop leader. At eleven he had denounced his uncle to the Thought Police
				after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies.
				At seventeen he had been a district organizer of the Junior Anti-Sex League. At nine
				teen he had designed a hand-grenade which had been adopted by the Ministry of Peace
				and which, at its first trial, had killed thirty-one Eurasian prisoners in one
				burst. At twenty-three he had perished in action. Pursued by enemy jet planes while
				flying over the Indian Ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body
				with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches and
				all — an end, said Big Brother, which it was impossible to contemplate without
				feelings of envy. Big Brother added a few remarks on the purity and
				single-mindedness of Comrade Ogilvy<span data-line="1675"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="1675"
				></span
				>s life. He was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily
				hour in the gymnasium, and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the
				care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty.
				He had no subjects of conversation except the principles of Ingsoc, and no aim in
				life except the defeat of the Eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of spies,
				saboteurs, thoughtcriminals, and traitors generally.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1685">
				<span data-line="1685"></span>Winston debated with himself whether to award Comrade
				Ogilvy the Order of Conspicuous Merit: in the end he decided against it because of
				the unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1690">
				<span data-line="1690"></span>Once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite
				cubicle. Something seemed to tell him with certainty that Tillotson was busy on the
				same job as himself. There was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted,
				but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own. Comrade Ogilvy,
				unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact. It struck him as curious that you could
				create dead men but not living ones. Comrade Ogilvy, who had never existed in the
				present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he
				would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as Charlemagne or
				Julius Caesar.

				paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the oily-tasting stuff down.
				When he had winked the tears out of his eyes he suddenly discovered that he was
				hungry. He began swallowing spoonfuls of the stew, which, in among its general
				sloppiness, had cubes of spongy pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of
				meat. Neither of them spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. From the

					>It&#39;s a beautiful thing, the destruction of words. Of course the great
					wastage is in the verbs and adjectives, but there are hundreds of nouns that can
					be got rid of as well. It isn&#39;t only the synonyms; there are also the
					antonyms. After all, what justification is there for a word which is simply the
					opposite of some other word? A word contains its opposite in itself. Take
					&#8220;good&#8221;, for instance. If you have a word like &#8220;good&#8221;,
					what need is there for a word like &#8220;bad&#8221;? &#8220;Ungood&#8221; will
					do just as well — better, because it&#39;s an exact opposite, which the other is
					not. Or again, if you want a stronger version of &#8220;good&#8221;, what sense
					is there in having a whole string of vague useless words like
					&#8220;excellent&#8221; and &#8220;splendid&#8221; and all the rest of them?
					&#8220;Plusgood&#8221; covers the meaning, or &#8220; doubleplusgood&#8221; if
					you want something stronger still. Of course we use those forms already. but in
					the final version of Newspeak there&#39;ll be nothing else. In the end the whole
					notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words — in reality,
					only one word. Don&#39;t you see the beauty of that, Winston? It was B.B.&#39;s
					idea originally, of course,</em

					Oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning. You
					don&#39;t grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. Do you know that

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1869">
				<span data-line="1869"></span>Winston did know that, of course. He smiled,

					>Don&#39;t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of
					thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because
					there will be no words in which to express it. Every concept that can ever be
					needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning rigidly defined
					and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten. Already, in the
					Eleventh Edition, we&#39;re not far from that point. But the process will still
					be continuing long after you and I are dead. Every year fewer and fewer words,
					and the range of consciousness always a little smaller. Even now, of course,
					there&#39;s no reason or excuse for committing thoughtcrime. It&#39;s merely a
					question of self-discipline, reality-control. But in the end there won&#39;t be

					By 2050 earlier, probably — all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have

					contradictory of what they used to be. Even the literature of the Party will
					change. Even the slogans will change. How could you have a slogan like
					&#8220;freedom is slavery&#8221; when the concept of freedom has been abolished?
					The whole climate of thought will be different. In fact there will be no

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1915">
				<span data-line="1915"></span>One of these days, thought Winston with sudden deep
				conviction, Syme will be vaporized. He is too intelligent. He sees too clearly and
				speaks too plainly. The Party does not like such people. One day he will disappear.
				It is written in his face.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1921">
				<span data-line="1921"></span>Winston had finished his bread and cheese. He turned a
				little sideways in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. At the table on his left
				the man with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. A young woman
				who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back to Winston, was
				listening to him and seemed to be eagerly agreeing with everything that he said.
				From time to time Winston caught some such remark as
				<span data-line="1928"></span>&#8216;_I think you&#39;re so right, I do so agree
				with you&#8217;<span data-line="1929"></span>, uttered in a youthful and rather
				silly feminine voice. But the other voice never stopped for an instant, even when
				the girl was speaking. Winston knew the man by sight, though he knew no more about
				him than that he held some important post in the Fiction Department. He was a man of
				about thirty, with a muscular throat and a large, mobile mouth. His head was thrown
				back a little, and because of the angle at which he was sitting, his spectacles
				caught the light and presented to Winston two blank discs instead of eyes. What was
				slightly horrible, was that from the stream of sound that poured out of his mouth it
				was almost impossible to distinguish a single word. Just once Winston caught a
				phrase-<span data-line="1940"></span>&#8216;complete and final elimination of
				Goldsteinism&#8217;<span data-line="1941"></span>- jerked out very rapidly and, as
				it seemed, all in one piece, like a line of type cast solid. For the rest it was
				just a noise, a quack-quack-quacking. And yet, though you could not actually hear
				what the man was saying, you could not be in any doubt about its general nature. He
				might be denouncing Goldstein and demanding sterner measures against
				thought-criminals and saboteurs, he might be fulminating against the atrocities of
				the Eurasian army, he might be praising Big Brother or the heroes on the Malabar
				front-it made no difference. Whatever it was, you could be certain that every word
				of it was pure orthodoxy, pure Ingsoc. As he watched the eyeless face with the jaw
				moving rapidly up and down, Winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real
				human being but some kind of dummy. It was not the man<span data-line="1954"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="1954"></span>s brain that was speaking, it was his larynx.
				The stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but it was not speech in
				the true sense: it was a noise uttered in unconsciousness, like the quacking of a
				duck.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1960">
				<span data-line="1960"></span>Syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the
				handle of his spoon was tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. The voice from the
				other table quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.

					>I don&#39;t know whether you know it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck. It is

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="1971">
				<span data-line="1971"></span>Unquestionably Syme will be vaporized, Winston thought
				again. He thought it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that Syme
				despised him and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a
				thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. There was something subtly wrong
				with Syme. There was something that he lacked: discretion, aloofness, a sort of
				saving stupidity. You could not say that he was unorthodox. He believed in the
				principles of Ingsoc, he venerated Big Brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated
				heretics, not merely with sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an
				up-to-dateness of information, which the ordinary Party member did not approach. Yet
				a faint air of disreputability always clung to him. He said things that would have
				been better unsaid, he had read too many books, he frequented the Chestnut Tree
				Café, haunt of painters and musicians. There was no law, not even an unwritten law,
				against frequenting the Chestnut Tree Café, yet the place was somehow ill-omened.
				The old, discredited leaders of the Party had been used to gather there before they
				were finally purged. Goldstein himself, it was said, had sometimes been seen there,
				years and decades ago. Syme<span data-line="1991"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="1991"

				>s fate was not difficult to foresee. And yet it was a fact that if Syme grasped,
				even for three seconds, the nature of his, Winston<span data-line="1993"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="1993"></span>s, secret opinions, he would betray him
				instantly to the Thought police. So would anybody else, for that matter: but Syme
				more than most. Zeal was not enough. Orthodoxy was unconsciousness.

				— a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a froglike face. At thirty-five he
				was already putting on rolls of fat at neck and waistline, but his movements were
				brisk and boyish. His whole appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much
				so that although he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almost impossible
				not to think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red
				neckerchief of the Spies. In visualizing him one saw always a picture of dimpled
				knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. Parsons did, indeed, invariably
				revert to shorts when a community hike or any other physical activity gave him an
				excuse for doing so. He greeted them both with a cheery
				<span data-line="2014"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Hullo, hullo!</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="2014"></span>
				and sat down at the table, giving off an intense smell of sweat. Beads of moisture
				stood out all over his pink face. His powers of sweating were extraordinary. At the
				Community Centre you could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the
				dampness of the bat handle. Syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a
				long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his fingers.

					class="em-low1"
					>our new, happy life</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="2105"></span> recurred several times. It had been a
				favourite of late with the Ministry of Plenty. Parsons, his attention caught by the
				trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity, a sort of edified
				boredom. He could not follow the figures, but he was aware that they were in some
				way a cause for satisfaction. He had lugged out a huge and filthy pipe which was
				already half full of charred tobacco. With the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week
				it was seldom possible to fill a pipe to the top. Winston was smoking a Victory
				Cigarette which he held carefully horizontal. The new ration did not start till
				tomorrow and he had only four cigarettes left. For the moment he had shut his ears
				to the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the
				telescreen. It appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank Big Brother
				for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. And only yesterday, he
				reflected, it had been announced that the ration was to be reduced to twenty grammes
				a week. Was it possible that they could swallow that, after only twenty-four hours?
				Yes, they swallowed it. Parsons swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an
				animal. The eyeless creature at the other table swallowed it fanatically,
				passionately, with a furious desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who
				should suggest that last week the ration had been thirty grammes. Syme, too-in some
				more complex way, involving doublethink, Syme swallowed it. Was he, then, alone in
				the possession of a memory?
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2132">
				<span data-line="2132"></span>The fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the
				telescreen. As compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more
				houses, more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters,
				more books, more babies — more of everything except disease, crime, and insanity.
				Year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was whizzing rapidly
				upwards. As Syme had done earlier Winston had taken up his spoon and was dabbling in
				the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across the table, drawing a long streak of it
				out into a pattern. He meditated resentfully on the physical texture of life. Had it
				always been like this? Had food always tasted like this? He looked round the
				canteen. A low-ceilinged, crowded room, its walls grimy from the contact of
				innumerable bodies; battered metal tables and chairs, placed so close together that
				you sat with elbows touching; bent spoons, dented trays, coarse white mugs; all
				surfaces greasy, grime in every crack; and a sourish, composite smell of bad gin and
				bad coffee and metallic stew and dirty clothes. Always in your stomach and in your
				skin there was a sort of protest, a feeling that you had been cheated of something
				that you had a right to. It was true that he had no memories of anything greatly
				different. In any time that he could accurately remember, there had never been quite
				enough to eat, one had never had socks or underclothes that were not full of holes,
				furniture had always been battered and rickety, rooms underheated, tube trains
				crowded, houses falling to pieces, bread dark-coloured, tea a rarity, coffee
				filthy-tasting, cigarettes insufficient — nothing cheap and plentiful except

				<span data-line="2170"></span>He looked round the canteen again. Nearly everyone was
				ugly, and would still have been ugly even if dressed otherwise than in the uniform
				blue overalls. On the far side of the room, sitting at a table alone, a small,
				curiously beetle-like man was drinking a cup of coffee, his little eyes darting
				suspicious glances from side to side. How easy it was, thought Winston, if you did
				not look about you, to believe that the physical type set up by the Party as an
				ideal-tall muscular youths and deep-bosomed maidens, blond-haired, vital, sunburnt,
				carefree — existed and even predominated. Actually, so far as he could judge, the
				majority of people in Airstrip One were small, dark, and ill-favoured. It was
				curious how that beetle-like type proliferated in the Ministries: little dumpy men,
				growing stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and
				fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. It was the type that seemed to flourish
				best under the dominion of the Party.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="2188">
				<span data-line="2188"></span>The announcement from the Ministry of Plenty ended on
				another trumpet call and gave way to tinny music. Parsons, stirred to vague
				enthusiasm by the bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="2205">
				<span data-line="2205"></span>The quacking voice from the next table, temporarily
				silenced during the Ministry<span data-line="2206"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="2206"
				></span
				>s announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. For some reason Winston
				suddenly found himself thinking of Mrs Parsons, with her wispy hair and the dust in
				the creases of her face. Within two years those children would be denouncing her to
				the Thought Police. Mrs Parsons would be vaporized. Syme would be vaporized. Winston
				would be vaporized. O<span data-line="2212"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="2212"
				></span
				>Brien would be vaporized. Parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized. The
				eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized. The little
				beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine corridors of
				Ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. And the girl with dark hair, the
				girl from the Fiction Department — she would never be vaporized either. It seemed to
				him that he knew instinctively who would survive and who would perish: though just
				what it was that made for survival, it was not easy to say.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2223">
				<span data-line="2223"></span>At this moment he was dragged out of his reverie with
				a violent jerk. The girl at the next table had turned partly round and was looking
				at him. It was the girl with dark hair. She was looking at him in a sidelong way,
				but with curious intensity. The instant she caught his eye she looked away again.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2230">
				<span data-line="2230"></span>The sweat started out on Winston<span
					data-line="2230"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="2230"></span>s backbone. A horrible pang of terror went
				through him. It was gone almost at once, but it left a sort of nagging uneasiness
				behind. Why was she watching him? Why did she keep following him about?
				Unfortunately he could not remember whether she had already been at the table when
				he arrived, or had come there afterwards. But yesterday, at any rate, during the Two
				Minutes Hate, she had sat immediately behind him when there was no apparent need to
				do so. Quite likely her real object had been to listen to him and make sure whether
				he was shouting loudly enough.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2242">
				<span data-line="2242"></span>His earlier thought returned to him: probably she was
				not actually a member of the Thought Police, but then it was precisely the amateur
				spy who was the greatest danger of all. He did not know how long she had been
				looking at him, but perhaps for as much as five minutes, and it was possible that
				his features had not been perfectly under control. It was terribly dangerous to let
				your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a
				telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away. A nervous tic, an unconscious
				look of anxiety, a habit of muttering to yourself — anything that carried with it
				the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide. In any case, to wear an
				improper expression on your face (to look incredulous when a victory was announced,
				for example) was itself a punishable offence. There was even a word for it in
				Newspeak: facecrime, it was called.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2258">
				<span data-line="2258"></span>The girl had turned her back on him again. Perhaps
				after all she was not really following him about, perhaps it was coincidence that
				she had sat so close to him two days running. His cigarette had gone out, and he
				laid it carefully on the edge of the table. He would finish smoking it after work,
				if he could keep the tobacco in it. Quite likely the person at the next table was a
				spy of the Thought Police, and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the
				Ministry of Love within three days, but a cigarette end must not be wasted. Syme had
				folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket. Parsons had begun
				talking again.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="2285">
				<span data-line="2285"></span>At this moment the telescreen let out a piercing
				whistle. It was the signal to return to work. All three men sprang to their feet to

			</blockquote>
			<p class="p noindent" data-line="2303">
				<span data-line="2303"></span>For the moment it was too difficult to go on. He shut
				his eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that
				kept recurring. He had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy
				words at the top of his voice. Or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over
				the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window — to do any violent or noisy or
				painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2312">
				<span data-line="2312"></span>Your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous
				system. At any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into
				some visible symptom. He thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few
				weeks back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a Party member, aged thirty-five to forty,
				tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case. They were a few metres apart when the left
				side of the man<span data-line="2318"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2318"></span>s
				face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm. It happened again just as they were
				passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a
				camera shutter, but obviously habitual. He remembered thinking at the time: That
				poor devil is done for. And what was frightening was that the action was quite
				possibly unconscious. The most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep. There
				was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2328">
				<span data-line="2328"></span>He drew his breath and went on writing:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2330">
				<span data-line="2330"></span>I went with her through the doorway and across a
				backyard into a basement kitchen. There was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on
				the table, turned down very low. She
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2334">
				<span data-line="2334"></span>His teeth were set on edge. He would have liked to
				spit. Simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of Katharine,
				his wife. Winston was married — had been married, at any rate: probably he still was
				married, so far as he knew his wife was not dead. He seemed to breathe again the
				warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty
				clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of
				the Party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so. Only the proles used
				scent. In his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2346">
				<span data-line="2346"></span>When he had gone with that woman it had been his first
				lapse in two years or thereabouts. Consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of
				course, but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to
				break. It was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter. To be caught with a
				prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp: not more, if you had
				committed no other offence. And it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid
				being caught in the act. The poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to
				sell themselves. Some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles
				were not supposed to drink. Tacitly the Party was even inclined to encourage
				prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed.
				Mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless and
				only involved the women of a submerged and despised class. The unforgivable crime
				was promiscuity between Party members. But — though this was one of the crimes that
				the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to — it was difficult to
				imagine any such thing actually happening.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2366">
				<span data-line="2366"></span>The aim of the Party was not merely to prevent men and
				women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control. Its real,
				undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act. Not love so much
				as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it. All marriages
				between Party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose,
				and — though the principle was never clearly stated — permission was always refused
				if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one
				another. The only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the
				service of the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly
				disgusting minor operation, like having an enema. This again was never put into
				plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every Party member from
				childhood onwards. There were even organizations such as the Junior Anti-Sex League,
				which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes. All children were to be begotten
				by artificial insemination (artsem, it was called in Newspeak) and brought up in
				public institutions. This, Winston was aware, was not meant altogether seriously,
				but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the Party. The Party was
				trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it
				and dirty it. He did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should
				be so. And as far as the women were concerned, the Party<span
					data-line="2390"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="2390"></span>s efforts were largely successful.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2393">
				<span data-line="2393"></span>He thought again of Katharine. It must be nine, ten —
				nearly eleven years since they had parted. It was curious how seldom he thought of
				her. For days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married.
				They had only been together for about fifteen months. The Party did not permit
				divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2401">
				<span data-line="2401"></span>Katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight,
				with splendid movements. She had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have
				called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing
				behind it. Very early in her married life he had decided — though perhaps it was
				only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people — that she had
				without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had ever encountered.
				She had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no
				imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the Party
				handed it out to her. <span data-line="2411"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>The human sound-track</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="2411"></span> he nicknamed her in his own mind. Yet he
				could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing — sex.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2415">
				<span data-line="2415"></span>As soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and
				stiffen. To embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image. And what was
				strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that
				she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength. The rigidlty of her
				muscles managed to convey that impression. She would lie there with shut eyes,
				neither resisting nor co-operating but submitting. It was extraordinarily
				embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible. But even then he could have borne living
				with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate. But curiously
				enough it was Katharine who refused this. They must, she said, produce a child if
				they could. So the performance continued to happen, once a week quite regulariy,
				whenever it was not impossible. She even used to remind him of it in the morning, as
				something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten. She had
				two names for it. One was <span data-line="2431"></span>&#8216;_making a
				baby&#8217;<span data-line="2431"></span>, and the other was
				<span data-line="2431"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">our duty to the Party</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="2432"></span> (yes, she had actually used that phrase).
				Quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came
				round. But luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying,
				and soon afterwards they parted.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2438">
				<span data-line="2438"></span>Winston sighed inaudibly. He picked up his pen again
				and wrote:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2441">
				<span data-line="2441"></span>She threw herself down on the bed, and at once,
				without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine,
				pulled up her skirt. I
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2445">
				<span data-line="2445"></span>He saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight,
				with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling
				of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of
				Katharine<span data-line="2448"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2448"></span>s white
				body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the Party. Why did it always have to
				be like this? Why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy
				scuffles at intervals of years? But a real love affair was an almost unthinkable
				event. The women of the Party were all alike. Chastity was as deep ingrained in them
				as Party loyalty. By careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the
				rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the Spies and the Youth League,
				by lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had
				been driven out of them. His reason told him that there must be exceptions, but his
				heart did not believe it. They were all impregnable, as the Party intended that they
				should be. And what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break down that
				wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his whole life. The sexual act,
				successfully performed, was rebellion. Desire was thoughtcrime. Even to have
				awakened Katharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been like a seduction,
				although she was his wife.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2468">
				<span data-line="2468"></span>But the rest of the story had got to be written down.
				He wrote:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2471">
				<span data-line="2471"></span>I turned up the lamp. When I saw her in the light
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2473">
				<span data-line="2473"></span>After the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin
				lamp had seemed very bright. For the first time he could see the woman properly. He
				had taken a step towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror. He was
				painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here. It was perfectly
				possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for that matter they might
				be waiting outside the door at this moment. If he went away without even doing what
				he had come here to do —<span data-line="2481"></span>
				<span data-line="2481"></span>!
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2483">
				<span data-line="2483"></span>It had got to be written down, it had got to be
				confessed. What he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old.
				The paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack
				like a cardboard mask. There were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly
				dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open, revealing nothing
				except a cavernous blackness. She had no teeth at all.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2491">
				<span data-line="2491"></span>He wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2493">
				<span data-line="2493"></span>When I saw her in the light she was quite an old
				woman, fifty years old at least. But I went ahead and did it just the same.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2497">
				<span data-line="2497"></span>He pressed his fingers against his eyelids again. He
				had written it down at last, but it made no difference. The therapy had not worked.
				The urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever.

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2507">
				<span data-line="2507"></span>If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because
				only there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of
				Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could not
				be overthrown from within. Its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming
				together or even of identifying one another. Even if the legendary Brotherhood
				existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever
				assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes. Rebellion meant a look in the eyes,
				an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word. But the
				proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength. would
				have no need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a

			<p class="p indent" data-line="2524">
				<span data-line="2524"></span>He remembered how once he had been walking down a
				crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices women<span

				had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding
				round the stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been
				the doomed passengers on a sinking ship. But at this moment the general despair
				broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels. It appeared that one of the
				stalls had been selling tin saucepans. They were wretched, flimsy things, but
				cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get. Now the supply had
				unexpectedly given out. The successful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were
				trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the
				stall, accusing the stall-keeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans
				somewhere in reserve. There was a fresh outburst of yells. Two bloated women, one of
				them with her hair coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to
				tear it out of one another<span data-line="2545"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="2545"

				>s hands. For a moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off. Winston
				watched them disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power
				had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could
				never shout like that about anything that mattered?

			<p class="p indent" data-line="2552"><span data-line="2552"></span>He wrote:</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2554">

			<p class="p indent" data-line="2558">
				<span data-line="2558"></span>That, he reflected, might almost have been a
				transcription from one of the Party textbooks. The Party claimed, of course, to have
				liberated the proles from bondage. Before the Revolution they had been hideously
				oppressed by the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been
				forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a
				matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age of six. But
				simultaneously, true to the Principles of doublethink, the Party taught that the
				proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection, like animals, by the
				application of a few simple rules. In reality very little was known about the
				proles. It was not necessary to know much. So long as they continued to work and
				breed, their other activities were without importance. Left to themselves, like
				cattle turned loose upon the plains of Argentina, they had reverted to a style of
				life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern. They were
				born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through
				a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they
				were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty. Heavy physical
				work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films,
				football, beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon of their minds. To
				keep them in control was not difficult. A few agents of the Thought Police moved
				always among them, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few
				individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made
				to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the Party. It was not desirable that the
				proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them was a
				primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make
				them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And even when they became
				discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because being
				without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The
				larger evils invariably escaped their notice. The great majority of proles did not
				even have telescreens in their homes. Even the civil police interfered with them
				very little. There was a vast amount of criminality in London, a whole
				world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and racketeers
				of every description; but since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was
				of no importance. In all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their
				ancestral code. The sexual puritanism of the Party was not imposed upon them.
				Promiscuity went unpunished, divorce was permitted. For that matter, even religious
				worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or
				wanting it. They were beneath suspicion. As the Party slogan put it:
				<span data-line="2606"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"

				<span data-line="2609"></span>Winston reached down and cautiously scratched his
				varicose ulcer. It had begun itching again. The thing you invariably came back to
				was the impossibility of knowing what life before the Revolution had really been
				like. He took out of the drawer a copy of a children<span data-line="2613"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="2613"></span>s history textbook which he had borrowed from
				Mrs Parsons, and began copying a passage into the diary:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2616">
				<span data-line="2616"></span>In the old days (it ran), before the glorious
				Revolution, London was not the beautiful city that we know today. It was a dark,
				dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and
				thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep
				under. Children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters
				who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but
				stale breadcrusts and water.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2626">
				<span data-line="2626"></span>But in among all this terrible poverty there were just
				a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as
				thirty servants to look after them. These rich men were called capitalists. They
				were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite
				page. You can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock
				coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat.
				This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it. The
				capitalists owned everything in the world, and everyone else was their slave. They
				owned all the land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money. If anyone
				disobeyed them they could throw them into prison, or they could take his job away
				and starve him to death. When any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to
				cringe and bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as
				<span data-line="2641"></span>&#8216;_Sir&#8217;<span data-line="2641"></span>. The
				chief of all the capitalists was called the King. and
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2644">
				<span data-line="2644"></span>But he knew the rest of the catalogue. There would be
				mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in their ermine robes, the
				pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o<span data-line="2647"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="2647"></span>-nine tails, the Lord Mayor<span
					data-line="2647"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="2647"></span>s Banquet, and the practice of kissing the
				Pope<span data-line="2648"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2648"></span>s toe. There
				was also something called the jus primae noctis, which would probably not be
				mentioned in a textbook for children. It was the law by which every capitalist had
				the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2654">
				<span data-line="2654"></span>How could you tell how much of it was lies? It might
				be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the
				Revolution. The only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own
				bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and
				that at some other time they must have been different. It struck him that the truly
				characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but
				simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness. Life, if you looked about you,
				bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but
				even to the ideals that the Party was trying to achieve. Great areas of it, even for
				a Party member, were neutral and non-political, a matter of slogging through dreary
				jobs, fighting for a place on the Tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a
				saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end. The ideal set up by the Party was
				something huge, terrible, and glittering — a world of steel and concrete, of
				monstrous machines and terrifying weapons — a nation of warriors and fanatics,
				marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the
				same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting — three hundred
				million people all with the same face. The reality was decaying, dingy cities where
				underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century
				houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. He seemed to see a vision of
				London, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it was a
				picture of Mrs Parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly
				with a blocked waste-pipe.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2684">
				<span data-line="2684"></span>He reached down and scratched his ankle again. Day and
				night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today
				had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations — that they lived
				longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more
				intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years ago. Not a word of it
				could ever be proved or disproved. The Party claimed, for example, that today 40 per
				cent of adult proles were literate: before the Revolution, it was said, the number
				had only been 15 per cent. The Party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now
				only 160 per thousand, whereas before the Revolution it had been 300 — and so it
				went on. It was like a single equation with two unknowns. It might very well be that
				literally every word in the history books, even the things that one accepted without
				question, was pure fantasy. For all he knew there might never have been any such law
				as the jus primae noctis, or any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment
				as a top hat.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2703">
				<span data-line="2703"></span>Everything faded into mist. The past was erased, the
				erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth. Just once in his life he had possessed
				— after the event: that was what counted — concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act
				of falsification. He had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds.
				In 1973, it must have been — at any rate,

			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="2714">
				<span data-line="2714"></span>The story really began in the middle sixties, the
				period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the Revolution were
				wiped out once and for all. By 1970 none of them was left, except Big Brother
				himself. All the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counter-
				revolutionaries. Goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where, and of the
				others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority had been executed after
				spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes. Among the
				last survivors were three men named Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. It must have
				been in 1965 that these three had been arrested. As often happened, they had
				vanished for a year or more, so that one did not know whether they were alive or
				dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the
				usual way. They had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the
				enemy was Eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various trusted
				Party members, intrigues against the leadership of Big Brother which had started
				long before the Revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the death of
				hundreds of thousands of people. After confessing to these things they had been
				pardoned, reinstated in the Party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures but
				which sounded important. All three had written long, abject articles in The Times,
				analysing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2740">
				<span data-line="2740"></span>Some time after their release Winston had actually
				seen all three of them in the Chestnut Tree Café. He remembered the sort of
				terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye.
				They were men far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last
				great figures left over from the heroic days of the Party. The glamour of the
				underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them. He had the
				feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he
				had known their names years earlier than he had known that of Big Brother. But also
				they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to
				extinction within a year or two. No one who had once fallen into the hands of the
				Thought Police ever escaped in the end. They were corpses waiting to be sent back to
				the grave.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2756">
				<span data-line="2756"></span>There was no one at any of the tables nearest to them.
				It was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people. They were
				sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the
				speciality of the café. Of the three, it was Rutherford whose appearance had most
				impressed Winston. Rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist, whose brutal
				cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the Revolution.
				Even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in The Times. They were
				simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing.
				Always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes — slum tenements, starving
				children, street battles, capitalists in top hats — even on the barricades the
				capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless, hopeless effort to
				get back into the past. He was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy grey hair, his
				face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips. At one time he must have been
				immensely strong; now his great body was sagging, sloping, bulging, falling away in
				every direction. He seemed to be breaking up before one<span data-line="2775"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="2775"></span>s eyes, like a mountain crumbling.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2778">
				<span data-line="2778"></span>It was the lonely hour of fifteen. Winston could not
				now remember how he had come to be in the café at such a time. The place was almost
				empty. A tinny music was trickling from the telescreens. The three men sat in their
				corner almost motionless, never speaking. Uncommanded, the waiter brought fresh
				glasses of gin. There was a chessboard on the table beside them, with the pieces set
				out but no game started. And then, for perhaps half a minute in all, something
				happened to the telescreens. The tune that they were playing changed, and the tone
				of the music changed too. There came into it — but it was something hard to
				describe. It was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note: in his mind Winston
				called it a yellow note. And then a voice from the telescreen was singing: Under the
				spreading chestnut tree I sold you and you sold me: There lie they, and here lie we
				Under the spreading chestnut tree.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2796">
				<span data-line="2796"></span>The three men never stirred. But when Winston glanced
				again at Rutherford<span data-line="2797"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2797"></span
				>s ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears. And for the first time he
				noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing at what he shuddered,
				that both Aaronson and Rutherford had broken noses.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2802">
				<span data-line="2802"></span>A little later all three were re-arrested. It appeared
				that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release.
				At their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with a
				whole string of new ones. They were executed, and their fate was recorded in the
				Party histories, a warning to posterity. About five years after this, in 1973,
				Winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic
				tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been
				slipped in among the others and then forgotten. The instant he had flattened it out
				he saw its significance. It was a half-page torn out of The Times of about ten years
				earlier — the top half of the page, so that it included the date — and it contained
				a photograph of the delegates at some Party function in New York. Prominent in the
				middle of the group were Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford. There was no mistaking
				them, in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2820">
				<span data-line="2820"></span>The point was that at both trials all three men had
				confessed that on that date they had been on Eurasian soil. They had flown from a
				secret airfield in Canada to a rendezvous somewhere in Siberia, and had conferred
				with members of the Eurasian General Staff, to whom they had betrayed important
				military secrets. The date had stuck in Winston<span data-line="2825"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="2825"></span>s memory because it chanced to be midsummer day;
				but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well. There was
				only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2830">
				<span data-line="2830"></span>Of course, this was not in itself a discovery. Even at
				that time Winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges
				had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of. But this was concrete
				evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up
				in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory. It was enough to blow the
				Party to atoms, if in some way it could have been published to the world and its
				significance made known.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2840">
				<span data-line="2840"></span>He had gone straight on working. As soon as he saw
				what the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet
				of paper. Luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of
				view of the telescreen.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2845">
				<span data-line="2845"></span>He took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back
				his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible. To keep your
				face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled,
				with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the
				telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up. He let what he judged to be ten
				minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear that some accident — a sudden
				draught blowing across his desk, for instance — would betray him. Then, without
				uncovering it again, he dropped the photograph into the memory hole, along with some
				other waste papers. Within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into
				ashes.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2858">
				<span data-line="2858"></span>That was ten — eleven years ago. Today, probably, he
				would have kept that photograph. It was curious that the fact of having held it in
				his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself,
				as well as the event it recorded, was only memory. Was the Party<span
					data-line="2862"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="2862"></span>s hold upon the past less strong, he wondered,
				because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed?
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2866">
				<span data-line="2866"></span>But today, supposing that it could be somehow
				resurrected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be evidence. Already, at
				the time when he made his discovery, Oceania was no longer at war with Eurasia, and
				it must have been to the agents of Eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed
				their country. Since then there had been other changes — two, three, he could not
				remember how many. Very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten
				until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance. The past
				not only changed, but changed continuously. What most afflicted him with the sense
				of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was
				undertaken. The immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the
				ultimate motive was mysterious. He took up his pen again and wrote:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2881">
				<span data-line="2881"></span>I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2883">
				<span data-line="2883"></span>He wondered, as he had many times wondered before,
				whether he himself was a lunatic. Perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one. At
				one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun;
				today, to believe that the past is inalterable. He might be alone in holding that
				belief, and if alone, then a lunatic. But the thought of being a lunatic did not
				greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also be wrong.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2892">
				<span data-line="2892"></span>He picked up the children<span data-line="2892"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="2892"></span>s history book and looked at the portrait of Big
				Brother which formed its frontispiece. The hypnotic eyes gazed into his own. It was
				as though some huge force were pressing down upon you — something that penetrated
				inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your
				beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses. In the end the
				Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it.
				It was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of
				their position demanded it. Not merely the validity of experience, but the very
				existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy. The heresy of
				heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you
				for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we know
				that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is
				unchangeable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if
				the mind itself is controllable what then?
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2912">
				<span data-line="2912"></span>But no! His courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its
				own accord. The face of O<span data-line="2913"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="2913"
				></span
				>Brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his mind. He
				knew, with more certainty than before, that O<span data-line="2915"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="2915"></span>Brien was on his side. He was writing the diary
				for O<span data-line="2916"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2916"></span>Brien — to
				O<span data-line="2916"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2916"></span>Brien: it was like
				an interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed to a
				particular person and took its colour from that fact.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2921">
				<span data-line="2921"></span>The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes
				and ears. It was their final, most essential command. His heart sank as he thought
				of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any Party
				intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not
				be able to understand, much less answer. And yet he was in the right! They were
				wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended.
				Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws do not change.
				Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall towards the earth<span

				>&#39;<span data-line="2931"></span>s centre. With the feeling that he was speaking
				to O<span data-line="2932"></span>&#39;<span data-line="2932"></span>Brien, and also
				that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2935">

				<span data-line="2940"></span>From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of
				roasting coffee — real coffee, not Victory Coffee — came floating out into the
				street. Winston paused involuntarily. For perhaps two seconds he was back in the
				half-forgotten world of his childhood. Then a door banged, seeming to cut off the
				smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="2947">
				<span data-line="2947"></span>He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and
				his varicose ulcer was throbbing. This was the second time in three weeks that he
				had missed an evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be
				certain that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked. In
				principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone except in bed. It
				was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would be taking
				part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anything that suggested a taste for
				solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. There
				was a word for it in Newspeak: ownlife, it was called, meaning individualism and
				eccentricity. But this evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the
				April air had tempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year,
				and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhausting games,
				the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable. On
				impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of
				London, first south, then east, then north again, losing himself among unknown
				streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going.

				>&#8217;<span data-line="2970"></span> The words kept coming back to him, statement
				of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity. He was somewhere in the vague,
				brown-coloured slums to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras
				Station. He was walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with
				battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow
				curiously suggestive of ratholes. There were puddles of filthy water here and there
				among the cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow alley-ways that
				branched off on either side, people swarmed in astonishing numbers — girls in full
				bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and swollen
				waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years<span

				bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who
				played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers. Perhaps
				a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up. Most of the
				people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded
				curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red forearms folded across thelr aprons
				were talking outside a doorway. Winston caught scraps of conversation as he
				approached.

				merely a kind of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some
				unfamiliar animal. The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a
				street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless you had
				definite business there. The patrols might stop you if you happened to run into
				them. <span data-line="3008"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>May I see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here? What time did you
					leave work? Is this your usual way home?</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3010"></span> — and so on and so forth. Not that there was
				any rule against walking home by an unusual route: but it was enough to draw
				attention to you if the Thought Police heard about it.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3015">
				<span data-line="3015"></span>Suddenly the whole street was in commotion. There were
				yells of warning from all sides. People were shooting into the doorways like
				rabbits. A young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up
				a tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it, and leapt back again,
				all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit, who
				had emerged from a side alley, ran towards Winston, pointing excitedly to the sky.

				was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to rocket bombs. Winston
				promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were nearly always right when they
				gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed to possess some kind of instinct which
				told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming, although the rockets
				supposedly travelled faster than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head.
				There was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects
				pattered on to his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered with
				fragments of glass from the nearest window.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3039">
				<span data-line="3039"></span>He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of
				houses 200 metres up the street. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below
				it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming around the ruins.
				There was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in the
				middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he saw that it
				was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so
				completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3049">
				<span data-line="3049"></span>He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to
				avoid the crowd, turned down a side-street to the right. Within three or four
				minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming
				life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly
				twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented (<span
					data-line="3054"
				></span
				>&#8216;pubs&#8217;<span data-line="3054"></span>, they called them) were choked
				with customers. From their grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and shutting, there
				came forth a smell of urine, sawdust, and sour beer. In an angle formed by a
				projecting house-front three men were standing very close together, the middle one
				of them holding a folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his
				shoulder. Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces,
				Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. It was obviously some
				serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a few paces away from them when
				suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation. For a
				moment they seemed almost on the point of blows.

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3088">
				<span data-line="3088"></span>They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked
				back when he had gone thirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate
				faces. The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public
				event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that there were
				some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only
				reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their
				intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could
				barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats
				of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling
				systems, forecasts, and lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of
				the Lottery, which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed
				everyone in the party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary. Only small
				sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being non-existent
				persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of Oceania
				and another, this was not difficult to arrange.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3109">
				<span data-line="3109"></span>But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had
				to cling on to that. When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you
				looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of
				faith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that he
				had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main thoroughfare not
				far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices. The street took
				a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley
				where a few stall-keepers were selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment
				Winston remembered where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down
				the next turning, not five minutes away, was the junk-shop where he had bought the
				blank book which was now his diary. And in a small stationer<span
					data-line="3122"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3122"></span>s shop not far away he had bought his penholder
				and his bottle of ink.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3125">
				<span data-line="3125"></span>He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the
				opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be
				frosted over but in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but
				active, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn, pushed
				open the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching, it occurred to him that
				the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had already been middle-aged when the
				Revolution happened. He and a few others like him were the last links that now
				existed with the vanished world of capitalism. In the Party itself there were not
				many people left whose ideas had been formed before the Revolution. The older
				generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the fifties and sixties,
				and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual
				surrender. If there was any one still alive who could give you a truthful account of
				conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a prole. Suddenly the
				passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into
				Winston<span data-line="3143"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3143"></span>s mind, and
				a lunatic impulse took hold of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape
				acquaintance with that old man and question him. He would say to him:
				<span data-line="3146"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Tell me about your life when you were a boy. What was it like in those days?
					Were things better than they are now, or were they worse?</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3148"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3150">
				<span data-line="3150"></span>Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become
				frightened, he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street. It was madness of
				course. As usual, there was no definite rule against talking to proles and
				frequenting their pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If
				the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not likely
				that they would believe him. He pushed open the door, and a hideous cheesy smell of
				sour beer hit him in the face. As he entered the din of voices dropped to about half
				its volume. Behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls. A game
				of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for
				perhaps as much as thirty seconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing at
				the bar, having some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed
				young man with enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing round with glasses in
				their hands, were watching the scene.

				<span data-line="3204"></span>The barman swished two half-litres of dark-brown beer
				into thick glasses which he had rinsed in a bucket under the counter. Beer was the
				only drink you could get in prole pubs. The proles were supposed not to drink gin,

				full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery
				tickets. Winston<span data-line="3210"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3210"></span>s

			<p class="p indent" data-line="3344">
				<span data-line="3344"></span>A sense of helplessness took hold of Winston. The old
				man<span data-line="3345"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3345"></span>s memory was
				nothing but a rubbish-heap of details. One could question him all day without
				getting any real information. The party histories might still be true, after a
				fashion: they might even be completely true. He made a last attempt.

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3359">
				<span data-line="3359"></span>The old man looked meditatively at the darts board. He
				finished up his beer, more slowly than before. When he spoke it was with a tolerant
				philosophical air, as though the beer had mellowed him.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3364">
				<span data-line="3364"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3376">
				<span data-line="3376"></span>Winston sat back against the window-sill. It was no
				use going on. He was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up
				and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extra
				half-litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his
				empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again.
				Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question,
				<span data-line="3383"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3384"></span> would have ceased once and for all to be
				answerable. But in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered
				survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another.
				They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a
				lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister<span data-line="3390"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3390"></span>s face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning
				seventy years ago: but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their
				vision. They were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones. And
				when memory failed and written records were falsified — when that happened, the
				claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be
				accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard
				against which it could be tested.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3399">
				<span data-line="3399"></span>At this moment his train of thought stopped abruptly.
				He halted and looked up. He was in a narrow street, with a few dark little shops,
				interspersed among dwelling-houses. Immediately above his head there hung three
				discoloured metal balls which looked as if they had once been gilded. He seemed to
				know the place. Of course! He was standing outside the junk-shop where he had bought
				the diary.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3407">
				<span data-line="3407"></span>A twinge of fear went through him. It had been a
				sufficiently rash act to buy the book in the beginning, and he had sworn never to
				come near the place again. And yet the instant that he allowed his thoughts to
				wander, his feet had brought him back here of their own accord. It was precisely
				against suicidal impulses of this kind that he had hoped to guard himself by opening
				the diary. At the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours
				the shop was still open. With the feeling that he would be less conspicuous inside
				than hanging about on the pavement, he stepped through the doorway. If questioned,
				he could plausibly say that he was trying to buy razor blades.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3420">
				<span data-line="3420"></span>The proprietor had just lighted a hanging oil lamp
				which gave off an unclean but friendly smell. He was a man of perhaps sixty, frail
				and bowed, with a long, benevolent nose, and mild eyes distorted by thick
				spectacles. His hair was almost white, but his eyebrows were bushy and still black.
				His spectacles, his gentle, fussy movements, and the fact that he was wearing an
				aged jacket of black velvet, gave him a vague air of intellectuality, as though he
				had been some kind of literary man, or perhaps a musician. His voice was soft, as
				though faded, and his accent less debased than that of the majority of proles.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3432">
				<span data-line="3432"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>I recognized you on the pavement,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3432"></span> he said immediately.
				<span data-line="3433"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>You&#39;re the gentleman that bought the young lady&#39;s keepsake album. That
					was a beautiful bit of paper, that was. Cream- laid, it used to be called.
					There&#39;s been no paper like that made for — oh, I dare say fifty years.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3436"></span> He peered at Winston over the top of his
				spectacles. <span data-line="3437"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Is there anything special I can do for you? Or did you just want to look
					round?</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3438"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3440">
				<span data-line="3440"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I was passing,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3440"></span> said Winston vaguely.
				<span data-line="3440"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>I just looked in. I don&#39;t want anything in particular.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3441"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3443">
				<span data-line="3443"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s just as well,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3443"></span> said the other,
				<span data-line="3443"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>because I don&#39;t suppose I could have satisfied you.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3444"></span> He made an apologetic gesture with his
				softpalmed hand. <span data-line="3445"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>You see how it is; an empty shop, you might say. Between you and me, the
					antique trade&#39;s just about finished. No demand any longer, and no stock
					either. Furniture, china, glass it&#39;s all been broken up by degrees. And of
					course the metal stuff&#39;s mostly been melted down. I haven&#39;t seen a brass
					candlestick in years.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3450"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3452">
				<span data-line="3452"></span>The tiny interior of the shop was in fact
				uncomfortably full, but there was almost nothing in it of the slightest value. The
				floorspace was very restricted, because all round the walls were stacked innumerable
				dusty picture-frames. In the window there were trays of nuts and bolts, worn-out
				chisels, penknives with broken blades, tarnished watches that did not even pretend
				to be in going order, and other miscellaneous rubbish. Only on a small table in the
				corner was there a litter of odds and ends — lacquered snuffboxes, agate brooches,
				and the like — which looked as though they might include something interesting. As
				Winston wandered towards the table his eye was caught by a round, smooth thing that
				gleamed softly in the lamplight, and he picked it up.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3466">
				<span data-line="3466"></span>It was a heavy lump of glass, curved on one side, flat
				on the other, making almost a hemisphere. There was a peculiar softness, as of
				rainwater, in both the colour and the texture of the glass. At the heart of it,
				magnified by the curved surface, there was a strange, pink, convoluted object that
				recalled a rose or a sea anemone.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3473">
				<span data-line="3473"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What is it?</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3473"></span>
				said Winston, fascinated.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3475">
				<span data-line="3475"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>That&#39;s coral, that is,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3475"></span> said the old man.
				<span data-line="3475"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>It must have come from the Indian Ocean. They used to kind of embed it in the
					glass. That wasn&#39;t made less than a hundred years ago. More, by the look of
					it.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3478"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3480">
				<span data-line="3480"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>It&#39;s a beautiful thing,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3480"></span> said Winston.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3482">
				<span data-line="3482"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>It is a beautiful thing,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3482"></span> said the other appreciatively.
				<span data-line="3483"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>But there&#39;s not many that&#39;d say so nowadays.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3483"></span> He coughed.
				<span data-line="3484"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Now, if it so happened that you wanted to buy it, that&#39;d cost you four
					dollars. I can remember when a thing like that would have fetched eight pounds,
					and eight pounds was — well, I can&#39;t work it out, but it was a lot of money.
					But who cares about genuine antiques nowadays even the few that&#39;s left?</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3488"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3490">
				<span data-line="3490"></span>Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and
				slid the coveted thing into his pocket. What appealed to him about it was not so
				much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite
				different from the present one. The soft, rainwatery glass was not like any glass
				that he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent
				uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a
				paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much
				of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a Party member to
				have in his possession. Anything old, and for that matter anything beautiful, was
				always vaguely suspect. The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after
				receiving the four dollars. Winston realized that he would have accepted three or
				even two.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3506">
				<span data-line="3506"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>There&#39;s another room upstairs that you might care to take a look at,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3507"></span> he said.
				<span data-line="3507"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>There&#39;s not much in it. Just a few pieces. We&#39;ll do with a light if
					we&#39;re going upstairs.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3508"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3510">
				<span data-line="3510"></span>He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way
				slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did
				not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of
				chimney-pots. Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the
				room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on the floor, a picture
				or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly arm-chair drawn up to the fireplace. An
				old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the
				mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying nearly a quarter of the room, was an
				enormous bed with the mattress still on it.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3522">
				<span data-line="3522"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>We lived here till my wife died,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3522"></span> said the old man half apologetically.
				<span data-line="3523"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3523"></span>_<span
					data-line="3523"
				></span
				>I<span data-line="3523"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3523"></span>m selling the

				>d find it a little bit cumbersome.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3528">
				<span data-line="3528"></span>He was holdlng the lamp high up, so as to illuminate
				the whole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The
				thought flitted through Winston<span data-line="3530"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="3530"
				></span
				>s mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a
				week, if he dared to take the risk. It was a wild, impossible notion, to be
				abandoned as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in him a sort of
				nostalgia, a sort of ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it
				felt like to sit in a room like this, in an arm-chair beside an open fire with your
				feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob; utterly alone, utterly secure, with
				nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of the
				kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3550">
				<span data-line="3550"></span>There was a small bookcase in the other corner, and
				Winston had already gravitated towards it. It contained nothing but rubbish. The
				hunting-down and destruction of books had been done with the same thoroughness in
				the prole quarters as everywhere else. It was very unlikely that there existed
				anywhere in Oceania a copy of a book printed earlier than 1960. The old man, still
				carrying the lamp, was standing in front of a picture in a rosewood frame which hung
				on the other side of the fireplace, opposite the bed.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3560">
				<span data-line="3560"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Now, if you happen to be interested in old prints at all -</em

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3563">
				<span data-line="3563"></span>Winston came across to examine the picture. It was a
				steel engraving of an oval building with rectangular windows, and a small tower in
				front. There was a railing running round the building, and at the rear end there was
				what appeared to be a statue. Winston gazed at it for some moments. It seemed
				vaguely familiar, though he did not remember the statue.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3570">
				<span data-line="3570"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>The frame&#39;s fixed to the wall,</em

			<p class="p indent" data-line="3573">
				<span data-line="3573"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">I know that building,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3573"></span> said Winston finally.
				<span data-line="3573"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>It&#39;s a ruin now. It&#39;s in the middle of the street outside the Palace of

			<p class="p indent" data-line="3577">
				<span data-line="3577"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"

				>&#8217;<span data-line="3579"></span> He smiled apologetically, as though conscious
				of saying something slightly ridiculous, and added:
				<span data-line="3581"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement&#39;s!</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3581"></span>

				<span data-line="3583"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">What&#39;s that?</em

					>Oh-&#8220;Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement&#39;s.&#8221; That
					was a rhyme we had when I was a little boy. How it goes on I don&#39;t remember,
					but I do know it ended up, &#8220;Here comes a candle to light you to bed, Here
					comes a chopper to chop off your head.&#8221; It was a kind of a dance. They
					held out their arms for you to pass under, and when they came to &#8220;Here
					comes a chopper to chop off your head&#8221; they brought their arms down and
					caught you. It was just names of churches. All the London churches were in it —
					all the principal ones, that is.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3593"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3595">
				<span data-line="3595"></span>Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church
				belonged. It was always difficult to determine the age of a London building.
				Anything large and impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was
				automatically claimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that
				was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle
				Ages. The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value.
				One could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from
				books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the names of streets — anything that
				might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered.

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3628">
				<span data-line="3628"></span>Winston knew the place well. It was a museum used for

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3637">
				<span data-line="3637"></span>Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an
				even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry
				home, unless it were taken out of its frame. But he lingered for some minutes more,
				talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not Weeks-as one might have
				gathered from the inscription over the shop-front — but Charrington. Mr Charrington,
				it seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty
				years. Throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window,
				but had never quite got to the point of doing it. All the while that they were
				talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston<span
					data-line="3648"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3648"></span>s head. Oranges and lemons say the bells of St
				Clement<span data-line="3649"></span>&#39;<span data-line="3649"></span>s, You owe
				me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin<span data-line="3650"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3650"></span>s! It was curious, but when you said it to
				yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London
				that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From one ghostly
				steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so far as he could
				remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3657">
				<span data-line="3657"></span>He got away from Mr Charrington and went down the
				stairs alone, so as not to let the old man see him reconnoitring the street before
				stepping out of the door. He had already made up his mind that after a suitable
				interval — a month, say — he would take the risk of visiting the shop again. It was
				perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the Centre. The serious piece
				of folly had been to come back here in the first place, after buying the diary and
				without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted. However-!
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3667">
				<span data-line="3667"></span>Yes, he thought again, he would come back. He would
				buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish. He would buy the engraving of St Clement
				Danes, take it out of its frame, and carry it home concealed under the jacket of his
				overalls. He would drag the rest of that poem out of Mr Charrington<span
					data-line="3671"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3671"></span>s memory. Even the lunatic project of renting
				the room upstairs flashed momentarily through his mind again. For perhaps five
				seconds exaltation made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without
				so much as a preliminary glance through the window. He had even started humming to
				an improvised tune
			</p>
			<pre
				class="para-block pre-indented"
				data-line="3678"
				style="display: block"
			><code>         Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement&#39;s,

			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="3681">
				<span data-line="3681"></span>Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his
				bowels to water. A figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten
				metres away. It was the girl from the Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair.
				The light was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She looked
				him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3689">
				<span data-line="3689"></span>For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move.
				Then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment
				that he was going in the wrong direction. At any rate, one question was settled.
				There was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She must have
				followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have
				happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet,
				kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members lived. It was too great a
				coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of the Thought Police, or simply an
				amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly mattered. It was enough that she was
				watching him. Probably she had seen him go into the pub as well.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3703">
				<span data-line="3703"></span>It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his
				pocket banged against his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out
				and throw it away. The worst thing was the pain in his belly. For a couple of
				minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon.
				But there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this. Then the spasm
				passed, leaving a dull ache behind.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3711">
				<span data-line="3711"></span>The street was a blind alley. Winston halted, stood
				for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to
				retrace his steps. As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him
				three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her. He could
				keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull in
				with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the
				job. But he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the thought of making any
				physical effort was unbearable. He could not run, he could not strike a blow.
				Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself. He thought also of
				hurrying to the Community Centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to
				establish a partial alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly
				lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit
				down and be quiet.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3728">
				<span data-line="3728"></span>It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the
				flat. The lights would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. He went
				into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to
				the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer. But he did
				not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a
				patriotic song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of the book, trying without
				success to shut the voice out of his consciousness.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3738">
				<span data-line="3738"></span>It was at night that they came for you, always at
				night. The proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly some
				people did so. Many of the disappearances were actually suicides. But it needed
				desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and
				certain poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind of astonishment
				of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body
				which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is
				needed. He might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only he had acted quickly
				enough: but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power
				to act. It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an
				external enemy, but always against one<span data-line="3751"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="3751"
				></span
				>s own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made
				consecutive thought impossible. And it is the same, he perceived, in all seemingly
				heroic or tragic situations. On the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a
				sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the
				body swells up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by
				fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or
				cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3762">
				<span data-line="3762"></span>He opened the diary. It was important to write
				something down. The woman on the telescreen had started a new song. Her voice seemed
				to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass. He tried to think of O<span
					data-line="3765"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3765"></span>Brien, for whom, or to whom, the diary was
				written, but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after
				the Thought Police took him away. It would not matter if they killed you at once. To
				be killed was what you expected. But before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet
				everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to be gone
				through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the crack of broken
				bones, the smashed teeth, and bloody clots of hair.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3775">
				<span data-line="3775"></span>Why did you have to endure it, since the end was
				always the same? Why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your
				life? Nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once
				you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be
				dead. Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in
				future time?
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3783">
				<span data-line="3783"></span>He tried with a little more success than before to
				summon up the image of O<span data-line="3784"></span>&#8216;Brien. &#8217;<span
					data-line="3784"
				></span
				><em class="em-low1">We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,</em

					data-line="3785"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3785"></span>Brien had said to him. He knew what it meant, or
				thought he knew. The place where there is no darkness was the imagined future, which
				one would never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. But
				with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train
				of thought further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco promptly fell
				out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again. The face
				of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing that of O<span data-line="3793"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3793"></span>Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier,
				he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy,
				calm, protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache? Like
				a leaden knell the words came back at him:

			<p class="p noindent" data-line="3805">
				<span data-line="3805"></span>It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left
				the cubicle to go to the lavatory.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3808">
				<span data-line="3808"></span>A solitary figure was coming towards him from the
				other end of the long, brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with dark hair. Four
				days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk-shop.
				As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a
				distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. Probably she had crushed
				her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of
				novels were <span data-line="3816"></span>&#8216;_roughed in&#8217;<span
					data-line="3816"
				></span
				>. It was a common accident in the Fiction Department.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3819">
				<span data-line="3819"></span>They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl
				stumbled and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her.
				She must have fallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had
				risen to her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her
				mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an appealing
				expression that looked more like fear than pain.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3827">
				<span data-line="3827"></span>A curious emotion stirred in Winston<span
					data-line="3827"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3827"></span>s heart. In front of him was an enemy who was
				trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps
				with a broken bone. Already he had instinctively started forward to help her. In the
				moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt
				the pain in his own body.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3834">
				<span data-line="3834"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You&#39;re hurt?</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3834"></span>
				he said.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3836">
				<span data-line="3836"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>It&#39;s nothing. My arm. It&#39;ll be all right in a second.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3836"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3838">
				<span data-line="3838"></span>She spoke as though her heart were fluttering. She had
				certainly turned very pale.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3841">
				<span data-line="3841"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"

					>No, I&#39;m all right. It hurt for a moment, that&#39;s all.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3843"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3845">
				<span data-line="3845"></span>She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her
				up. She had regained some of her colour, and appeared very much better.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3849">
				<span data-line="3849"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">It&#39;s nothing,</em

					>I only gave my wrist a bit of a bang. Thanks, comrade!</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="3850"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3852">
				<span data-line="3852"></span>And with that she walked on in the direction in which
				she had been going, as briskly as though it had really been nothing. The whole
				incident could not have taken as much as half a minute. Not to let one<span
					data-line="3855"

					data-line="3855"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3855"></span>s face was a habit that had acquired the status
				of an instinct, and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a
				telescreen when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had been very difficult not to
				betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was helping
				her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. There was no question that she
				had done it intentionally. It was something small and flat. As he passed through the
				lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his
				fingers. It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3867">
				<span data-line="3867"></span>While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little
				more fingering, to get it unfolded. Obviously there must be a message of some kind
				written on it. For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets
				and read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew. There was no
				place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched
				continuously.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3875">
				<span data-line="3875"></span>He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the
				fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles
				and hitched the speakwrite towards him. <span data-line="3877"></span>&#8216;<em
					class="em-low1"

				His heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness. Fortunately the piece of
				work he was engaged on was mere routine, the rectification of a long list of
				figures, not needing close attention.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="3884">
				<span data-line="3884"></span>Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some
				kind of political meaning. So far as he could see there were two possibilities. One,
				much the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police, just as
				he had feared. He did not know why the Thought Police should choose to deliver their
				messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had their reasons. The thing that was
				written on the paper might be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide, a
				trap of some description. But there was another, wilder possibility that kept
				raising its head, though he tried vainly to suppress it. This was, that the message
				did not come from the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground
				organization. Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the girl was part
				of it! No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very
				instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till a couple of
				minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred to him. And
				even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably meant death —
				still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable hope persisted, and his
				heart banged, and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he
				murmured his figures into the speakwrite.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3907">
				<span data-line="3907"></span>He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it
				into the pneumatic tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles on
				his nose, sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of
				paper on top of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large unformed
				handwriting:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3914"><span data-line="3914"></span>I love you.</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3916">
				<span data-line="3916"></span>For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw
				the incriminating thing into the memory hole. When he did so, although he knew very
				well the danger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it once
				again, just to make sure that the words were really there.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3922">
				<span data-line="3922"></span>For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to
				work. What was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs
				was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. He felt as though a fire
				were burning in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen was
				torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour, but as
				bad luck would have it the imbecile Parsons flopped down beside him, the tang of his
				sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream of talk about
				the preparations for Hate Week. He was particularly enthusiastic about a
				papier-mâché model of Big Brother<span data-line="3932"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="3932"
				></span
				>s head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by his daughter<span
					data-line="3933"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="3933"></span>s troop of Spies. The irritating thing was that
				in the racket of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was
				constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just once he caught
				a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room.
				She appeared not to have seen him, and he did not look in that direction again.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3942">
				<span data-line="3942"></span>The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after
				lunch there arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several
				hours and necessitated putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying a
				series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on
				a prominent member of the Inner Party, who was now under a cloud. This was the kind
				of thing that Winston was good at, and for more than two hours he succeeded in
				shutting the girl out of his mind altogether. Then the memory of her face came back,
				and with it a raging, intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could be alone it was
				impossible to think this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at the
				Community Centre. He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried off to
				the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a
				<span data-line="3955"></span>&#8216;_discussion group&#8217;<span
					data-line="3956"
				></span
				>, played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and sat for
				half an hour through a lecture entitled <span data-line="3958"></span>&#8216;_Ingsoc
				in relation to chess&#8217;<span data-line="3958"></span>. His soul writhed with
				boredom, but for once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the Centre. At
				the sight of the words I love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and
				the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three
				hours, when he was home and in bed — in the darkness, where you were safe even from
				the telescreen so long as you kept silent — that he was able to think continuously.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3967">
				<span data-line="3967"></span>It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how
				to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not consider any longer
				the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. He knew that it
				was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note.
				Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well she might be. Nor did the
				idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind. Only five nights ago he had
				contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone, but that was of no
				importance. He thought of her naked, youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream.
				He had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and
				hatred, her belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he
				might lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! What he feared
				more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get
				in touch with her quickly. But the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous. It
				was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated. Whichever way
				you turned, the telescreen faced you. Actually, all the possible ways of
				communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note;
				but now, with time to think, he went over them one by one, as though laying out a
				row of instruments on a table.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="3991">
				<span data-line="3991"></span>Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this
				morning could not be repeated. If she had worked in the Records Department it might
				have been comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the
				building the Fiction Departrnent lay, and he had no pretext for going there. If he
				had known where she lived, and at what time she left work, he could have contrived
				to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try to follow her home was not safe,
				because it would mean loitering about outside the Ministry, which was bound to be
				noticed. As for sending a letter through the mails, it was out of the question. By a
				routine that was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, few
				people ever wrote letters. For the messages that it was occasionally necessary to
				send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases, and you struck out
				the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he did not know the girl<span
					data-line="4006"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="4006"></span>s name, let alone her address. Finally he
				decided that the safest place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by
				herself, somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and with
				a sufficient buzz of conversation all round — if these conditions endured for, say,
				thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few words.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4014">
				<span data-line="4014"></span>For a week after this, life was like a restless dream.
				On the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the
				whistle having already blown. Presumably she had been changed on to a later shift.
				They passed each other without a glance. On the day after that she was in the
				canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately under a
				telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all. His whole mind
				and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of
				transparency, which made every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that
				he had to speak or listen to, an agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape
				from her image. He did not touch the diary during those days. If there was any
				relief, it was in his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten
				minutes at a stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her.
				There was no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporized, she might have
				committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end of Oceania:
				worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind and decided to
				avoid him.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4035">
				<span data-line="4035"></span>The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the
				sling and she had a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist. The relief of seeing
				her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several
				seconds. On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he
				came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall, and was
				quite alone. It was early, and the place was not very full. The queue edged forward
				till Winston was almost at the counter, then was held up for two minutes because
				someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine.
				But the girl was still alone when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her
				table. He walked casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table
				beyond her. She was perhaps three metres away from him. Another two seconds would do
				it. Then a voice behind him called, <span data-line="4050"></span>&#8216;<em
					class="em-low1"
					>Smith!</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="4050"></span> He pretended not to hear.
				<span data-line="4050"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Smith!</em>&#8217;<span
					data-line="4050"
				></span>
				repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He turned round. A blond-headed,
				silly-faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a
				smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not safe to refuse. After having been
				recognized, he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl. It was too
				noticeable. He sat down with a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his.
				Winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of
				it. The girl<span data-line="4059"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4059"></span>s table
				filled up a few minutes later.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4062">
				<span data-line="4062"></span>But she must have seen him coming towards her, and
				perhaps she would take the hint. Next day he took care to arrive early. Surely
				enough, she was at a table in about the same place, and again alone. The person
				immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man
				with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from the counter
				with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight for the girl<span
					data-line="4069"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="4069"></span>s table. His hopes sank again. There was a
				vacant place at a table further away, but something in the little man<span
					data-line="4071"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="4071"></span>s appearance suggested that he would be
				sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table. With ice at
				his heart Winston followed. It was no use unless he could get the girl alone. At
				this moment there was a tremendous crash. The little man was sprawling on all fours,
				his tray had gone flying, two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the
				floor. He started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom he evidently
				suspected of having tripped him up. But it was all right. Five seconds later, with a
				thundering heart, Winston was sitting at the girl<span data-line="4080"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="4080"></span>s table.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4082">
				<span data-line="4082"></span>He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and
				promptly began eating. It was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else
				came, but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him. A week had gone by since
				she had first approached him. She would have changed her mind, she must have changed
				her mind! It was impossible that this affair should end successfully; such things
				did not happen in real life. He might have flinched altogether from speaking if at
				this moment he had not seen Ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round
				the room with a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth
				was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught
				sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. Both Winston and the girl
				were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating was a thin stew, actually a soup,
				of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston began speaking. Neither of them looked up;
				steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls
				exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless voices.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="4125">
				<span data-line="4125"></span>Ampleforth failed to see Winston and sat down at
				another table. They did not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two
				people sitting on opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one
				another. The girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while Winston stayed to
				smoke a cigarette.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4132">
				<span data-line="4132"></span>Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed
				time. He wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which
				Big Brother<span data-line="4134"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4134"></span>s statue
				gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the Eurasian aeroplanes
				(the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years ago) in the Battle of Airstrip
				One. In the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was
				supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell. At five minutes past the hour the girl had
				still not appeared. Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming,
				she had changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the north side of the square and
				got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin<span
					data-line="4143"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="4143"></span>s Church, whose bells, when it had bells, had
				chimed <span data-line="4144"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>You owe me three farthings.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="4145"></span> Then he saw the girl standing at the base of
				the monument, reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the
				column. It was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated. There
				were telescreens all round the pediment. But at this moment there was a din of
				shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. Suddenly everyone
				seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped nimbly round the lions at
				the base of the monument and joined in the rush. Winston followed. As he ran, he
				gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4157">
				<span data-line="4157"></span>Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south
				side of the square. Winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to
				the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward
				into the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm<span data-line="4161"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="4161"></span>s length of the girl, but the way was blocked by
				an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife, who
				seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways, and
				with a violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it
				felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips,
				then he had broken through, sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were
				shoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4171">
				<span data-line="4171"></span>A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed
				with sub-machine guns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the
				street. In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting,
				jammed close together. Their sad, Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the
				trucks utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clank-clank
				of metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons. Truck-load after truck-load of
				the sad faces passed. Winston knew they were there but he saw them only
				intermittently. The girl<span data-line="4180"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="4180"
				></span
				>s shoulder, and her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her
				cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately taken
				charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. She began speaking in
				the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely moving, a mere murmur
				easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="4199">
				<span data-line="4199"></span>With a sort of military precision that astonished him,

			<p class="p indent" data-line="4221">
				<span data-line="4221"></span>She need not have told him that. But for the moment
				they could not extricate themselves from the crowd. The trucks were still filing
				post, the people still insatiably gaping. At the start there had been a few boos and
				hisses, but it came only from the Party members among the crowd, and had soon
				stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners, whether from
				Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange animal. One literally never saw
				them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prisoners one never got more than
				a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did one know what became of them, apart from the
				few who were hanged as war-criminals: te others simply vanished, presumably into
				forced-labour camps. The round Mogol faces had given way to faces of a more European
				type, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into
				Winston<span data-line="4235"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4235"></span>s, sometimes
				with strange intensity, and flashed away again. The convoy was drawing to an end. In
				the last truck he could see an aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing
				upright with wrists crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having them
				bound together. It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part. But at the last
				moment, while the crowd still hemmed them in, her hand felt for his and gave it a
				fleeting squeeze.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4244">
				<span data-line="4244"></span>It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed
				a long time that their hands were clasped together. He had time to learn every
				detail of her hand. He explored the long fingers, the shapely nails, the
				work-hardened palm with its row of callouses, the smooth flesh under the wrist.
				Merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the same instant it
				occurred to him that he did not know what colour the girl<span
					data-line="4250"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="4250"></span>s eyes were. They were probably brown, but
				people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at her
				would have been inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible among the
				press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyes of
				the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston out of nests of
				hair.

				<span data-line="4261"></span>Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled
				light and shade, stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. Under
				the trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells. The air seemed to
				kiss one<span data-line="4264"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4264"></span>s skin. It
				was the second of May. From somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the
				droning of ring doves.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4268">
				<span data-line="4268"></span>He was a bit early. There had been no difficulties
				about the journey, and the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less
				frightened than he would normally have been. Presumably she could be trusted to find
				a safe place. In general you could not assume that you were much safer in the
				country than in London. There were no telescreens, of course, but there was always
				the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and
				recognized; besides, it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without
				attracting attention. For distances of less than 100 kilometres it was not necessary
				to get your passport endorsed, but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the
				railway stations, who examined the papers of any Party member they found there and
				asked awkward questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the
				station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not being
				followed. The train was full of proles, in holiday mood because of the summery
				weather. The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was filled to overflowing
				by a single enormous family. ranging from a toothless great-grandmother to a
				month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon with
				<span data-line="4288"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">in-laws</em>&#8217;<span
					data-line="4288"
				></span>
				in the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston, to get hold of a little
				blackmarket butter.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4292">
				<span data-line="4292"></span>The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the
				footpath she had told him of, a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes.
				He had no watch, but it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick
				underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began
				picking some partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that he would
				like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they met. He had got
				together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his
				back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs. He went on picking
				bluebells. It was the best thing to do. It might be the girl, or he might have been
				followed after all. To look round was to show guilt. He picked another and another.
				A hand fell lightly on his shoulder.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4307">
				<span data-line="4307"></span>He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head,
				evidently as a warning that he must keep silent, then parted the bushes and quickly
				led the way along the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that way
				before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed, still
				clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feeling was relief, but as he watched the
				strong slender body moving in front of him, with the scarlet sash that was just
				tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips, the sense of his own inferiority
				was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round and
				looked at him she would draw back after all. The sweetness of the air and the
				greenness of the leaves daunted him. Already on the walk from the station the May
				sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the
				sooty dust of London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him that till now she
				had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to the fallen
				tree that she had spoken of. The girl hopped over and forced apart the bushes, in
				which there did not seem to be an opening. When Winston followed her, he found that
				they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings
				that shut it in completely. The girl stopped and turned.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="4350">
				<span data-line="4350"></span>They were only making conversation. He had managed to
				move closer to her now. She stood before him very upright, with a smile on her face
				that looked faintly ironical, as though she were wondering why he was so slow to
				act. The bluebells had cascaded on to the ground. They seemed to have fallen of
				their own accord. He took her hand.

				The youthful body was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against
				his face, and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide
				red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling him darling,
				precious one, loved one. He had pulled her down on to the ground, she was utterly
				unresisting, he could do what he liked with her. But the truth was that he had no
				physical sensation, except that of mere contact. All he felt was incredulity and
				pride. He was glad that this was happening, but he had no physical desire. It was
				too soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to
				living without women — he did not know the reason. The girl picked herself up and
				pulled a bluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting her arm round his
				waist.

				Junior Anti-Sex League and flinging it on to a bough. Then, as though touching her
				waist had reminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of her overalls and
				produced a small slab of chocolate. She broke it in half and gave one of the pieces
				to Winston. Even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very
				unusual chocolate. It was dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper. Chocolate
				normally was dull-brown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe
				it, like the smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another he had tasted
				chocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff of its scent had stirred
				up some memory which he could not pin down, but which was powerful and troubling.

				Inner Party, about whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made Winston
				feel uneasy, although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe
				anywhere. A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language.
				Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom did swear,
				aloud, at any rate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mention the Party, and
				especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words that you saw chalked up
				in dripping alley-ways. He did not dislike it. It was merely one symptom of her
				revolt against the Party and all its ways, and somehow it seemed natural and
				healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay. They had left the clearing
				and were wandering again through the chequered shade, with their arms round each
				other<span data-line="4485"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4485"></span>s waists
				whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. He noticed how much softer her
				waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. They did not speak above a whisper.
				Outside the clearing, Julia said, it was better to go quietly. Presently they had
				reached the edge of the little wood. She stopped him.

				<span data-line="4495"></span>They were standing in the shade of hazel bushes. The
				sunlight, filtering through innumerable leaves, was still hot on their faces.
				Winston looked out into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of
				recognition. He knew it by sight. An old, closebitten pasture, with a footpath
				wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the
				opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze, and
				their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women<span data-line="4503"></span

			<p class="p indent" data-line="4523">
				<span data-line="4523"></span>A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away,
				almost at the level of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun,
				they in the shade. It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place again,
				ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, and
				then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the afternoon hush the volume of
				sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung together, fascinated. The music went on
				and on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never once repeating
				itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity.
				Sometimes it stopped for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then
				swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a
				sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate, no
				rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its
				music into nothingness? He wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden
				somewhere near. He and Julia had spoken only in low whispers, and it would not pick
				up what they had said, but it would pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of
				the instrument some small, beetle-like man was listening intently — listening to
				that. But by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It
				was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed
				up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. He stopped thinking and
				merely felt. The girl<span data-line="4548"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="4548"
				></span
				>s waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm. He pulled her round so that they
				were breast to breast; her body seemed to melt into his. Wherever his hands moved it
				was all as yielding as water. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different
				from the hard kisses they had exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces apart
				again both of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright and fled with a clatter of
				wings.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="4557">

				Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes off, and when she
				flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole

				<span data-line="4591"></span>His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he
				wished it had been hundreds — thousands. Anything that hinted at corruption always

				<span data-line="4617"></span>That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely
				the love of one person but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire:
				that was the force that would tear the Party to pieces. He pressed her down upon the
				grass, among the fallen bluebells. This time there was no difficulty. Presently the
				rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed, and in a sort of
				pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The sun seemed to have grown hotter. They
				were both sleepy. He reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly
				over her. Almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4629">
				<span data-line="4629"></span>Winston woke first. He sat up and watched the freckled
				face, still peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of her hand. Except for her
				mouth, you could not call her beautiful. There was a line or two round the eyes, if
				you looked closely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft. It
				occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she lived.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4637">
				<span data-line="4637"></span>The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke
				in him a pitying, protecting feeling. But the mindless tenderness that he had felt
				under the hazel tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite come back. He
				pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank. In the old days, he
				thought, a man looked at a girl<span data-line="4642"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="4642"
				></span
				>s body and saw that it was desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you
				could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because
				everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the
				climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.

				<span data-line="4655"></span>As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed. She
				became alert and business-like, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about
				her waist, and began arranging the details of the journey home. It seemed natural to
				leave this to her. She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked, and
				she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London,
				stored away from innumerable community hikes. The route she gave him was quite
				different from the one by which he had come, and brought him out at a different

					>Never go home the same way as you went out,</em

				before following her.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4669">
				<span data-line="4669"></span>She had named a place where they could meet after
				work, four evenings hence. It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where
				there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy. She would be hanging
				about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing-thread. If
				she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached;
				otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition. But with luck, in the middle
				of the crowd, it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another
				meeting.

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4687">
				<span data-line="4687"></span>She flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost
				violently, and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared
				into the wood with very little noise. Even now he had not found out her surname or
				her address. However, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that they
				could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4695">
				<span data-line="4695"></span>As it happened, they never went back to the clearing
				in the wood. During the month of May there was only one further occasion on which
				they actually succeeded in making love. That was in another hidlng-place known to
				Julia, the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of country where
				an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier. It was a good hiding-place when once
				you got there, but the getting there was very dangerous. For the rest they could
				meet only in the streets, in a different place every evening and never for more than
				half an hour at a time. In the street it was usually possible to talk, after a
				fashion. As they drifted down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never
				looking at one another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which
				flicked on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence by
				the approach of a Party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then taken up
				again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly cut short as they
				parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without introduction on the
				following day. Julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation, which
				she called <span data-line="4714"></span>&#8216;_talking by instalments&#8217;<span
					data-line="4715"
				></span
				>. She was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips. Just once in
				almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss. They were
				passing in silence down a side-street (Julia would never speak when they were away
				from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the earth heaved, and the
				air darkened, and Winston found himself lying on his side, bruised and terrified. A
				rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand. Suddenly he became aware of
				Julia<span data-line="4723"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4723"></span>s face a few
				centimetres from his own, deathly white, as white as chalk. Even her lips were
				white. She was dead! He clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live
				warm face. But there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips. Both of
				their faces were thickly coated with plaster.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4730">
				<span data-line="4730"></span>There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous
				and then had to walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come
				round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead. Even if it had been less
				dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet. Winston<span
					data-line="4734"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="4734"></span>s working week was sixty hours, Julia<span
					data-line="4735"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="4735"></span>s was even longer, and their free days varied
				according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide. Julia, in any case,
				seldom had an evening completely free. She spent an astonishing amount of time in
				attending lectures and demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior
				Anti-Sex League, preparing banners for Hate Week, making collections for the savings
				campaign, and such-like activities. It paid, she said, it was camouflage. If you
				kept the small rules, you could break the big ones. She even induced Winston to
				mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part-time munition
				work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party members. So, one evening every
				week, Winston spent four hours of paralysing boredom, screwing together small bits
				of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses, in a draughty, ill-lit workshop
				where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4753">
				<span data-line="4753"></span>When they met in the church tower the gaps in their
				fragmentary conversation were filled up. It was a blazing afternoon. The air in the
				little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly
				of pigeon dung. They sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig-littered floor, one or
				other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits
				and make sure that no one was coming.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4762">
				<span data-line="4762"></span>Julia was twenty-six years old. She lived in a hostel
				with thirty other girls (<span data-line="4763"></span>&#8216;Always in the stink of
				women! How I hate women!_&#8217;<span data-line="4764"></span> she said
				parenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writing machines
				in the Fiction Department. She enjoyed her work, which consisted chiefly in running
				and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor. She was
				<span data-line="4768"></span>&#8216;_not clever&#8217;<span data-line="4768"></span
				>, but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery. She could
				describe the whole process of composing a novel, from the general directive issued
				by the Planning Committee down to the final touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But
				she was not interested in the finished product. She
				<span data-line="4773"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>didn&#39;t much care for reading,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="4773"></span> she said. Books were just a commodity that
				had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4776">
				<span data-line="4776"></span>She had no memories of anything before the early
				sixties and the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days
				before the Revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight. At
				school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two
				years running. She had been a troop-leader in the Spies and a branch secretary in
				the Youth League before joining the Junior Anti-Sex League. She had always borne an
				excellent character. She had even (an infallible mark of good reputation) been
				picked out to work in Pornosec, the sub-section of the Fiction Department which
				turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles. It was nicknamed
				Muck House by the people who worked in it, she remarked. There she had remained for
				a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like Spanking
				Stories or One Night in a Girls<span data-line="4790"></span>_<span
					data-line="4790"

					>Oh, ghastly rubbish. They&#39;re boring, really. They only have six plots, but

			<p class="p indent" data-line="4802">
				<span data-line="4802"></span>He learned with astonishment that all the workers in
				Pornosec, except the heads of the departments, were girls. The theory was that men,
				whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women, were in greater
				danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled.

				<span data-line="4812"></span>She had had her first love-affair when she was

				>&#8217;<span data-line="4815"></span> Since then there had been various others.
				Life as she saw it was quite simple. You wanted a good time;
				<span data-line="4817"></span>&#8216;_they&#8217;<span data-line="4817"></span>,
				meaning the Party, wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you
				couId. She seemed to think it just as natural that
				<span data-line="4820"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">they</em>&#8217;<span
					data-line="4820"
				></span>
				should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being
				caught. She hated the Party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no
				general criticism of it. Except where it touched upon her own life she had no
				interest in Party doctrine. He noticed that she never used Newspeak words except the
				ones that had passed into everyday use. She had never heard of the Brotherhood, and
				refused to believe in its existence. Any kind of organized revolt against the Party,
				which was bound to be a failure, struck her as stupid. The clever thing was to break
				the rules and stay alive all the same. He wondered vaguely how many others like her
				there might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the
				Revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the Party as something unalterable, like
				the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it, as a rabbit
				dodges a dog.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4837">
				<span data-line="4837"></span>They did not discuss the possibility of getting
				married. It was too remote to be worth thinking about. No imaginable committee would
				ever sanction such a marriage even if Katharine, Winston<span
					data-line="4840"

				>&#39;<span data-line="4840"></span>s wife, could somehow have been got rid of. It
				was hopeless even as a daydream.

				<span data-line="4845"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4852">
				<span data-line="4852"></span>He began telling her the story of his married life,
				but curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it already. She
				described to him, almost as though she had seen or felt it, the stiffening of
				Katharine<span data-line="4855"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4855"></span>s body as
				soon as he touched her, the way in which she still seemed to be pushing him from her
				with all her strength, even when her arms were clasped tightly round him. With Julia
				he felt no difficulty in talking about such things: Katharine, in any case, had long
				ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="4863">

				<span data-line="4866"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"

					>I&#39;ve been at school too, dear. Sex talks once a month for the

				>&#8217;<span data-line="4876"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4878">
				<span data-line="4878"></span>She began to enlarge upon the subject. With Julia,
				everything came back to her own sexuality. As soon as this was touched upon in any
				way she was capable of great acuteness. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner
				meaning of the Party<span data-line="4882"></span>&#39;<span data-line="4882"></span
				>s sexual puritanism. It was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its
				own which was outside the Party<span data-line="4884"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="4884"
				></span
				>s control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more
				important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable because it
				could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship. The way she put it was:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4890">
				<span data-line="4890"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>When you make love you&#39;re using up energy; and afterwards you feel happy
					and don&#39;t give a damn for anything. They can&#39;t bear you to feel like
					that. They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching
					up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour. If you&#39;re
					happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother and the
					Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody
					rot?</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="4897"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4899">
				<span data-line="4899"></span>That was very true, he thought. There was a direct
				intimate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxy. For how could the fear,
				the hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be kept
				at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a
				driving force? The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party, and the Party had turned
				it to account. They had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood. The
				family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be
				fond of their children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other
				hand, were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and
				report their deviations. The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought
				Police. It was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day
				by informers who knew him intimately.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4916">
				<span data-line="4916"></span>Abruptly his mind went back to Katharine. Katharine
				would unquestionably have denounced him to the Thought Police if she had not
				happened to be too stupid to detect the unorthodoxy of his opinions. But what really
				recalled her to him at this moment was the stifling heat of the afternoon, which had
				brought the sweat out on his forehead. He began telling Julia of something that had
				happened, or rather had failed to happen, on another sweltering summer afternoon,
				eleven years ago.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="4925">
				<span data-line="4925"></span>It was three or four months after they were married.
				They had lost their way on a community hike somewhere in Kent. They had only lagged
				behind the others for a couple of minutes, but they took a wrong turning, and
				presently found themselves pulled up short by the edge of an old chalk quarry. It
				was a sheer drop of ten or twenty metres, with boulders at the bottom. There was
				nobody of whom they could ask the way. As soon as she realized that they were lost
				Katharine became very uneasy. To be away from the noisy mob of hikers even for a
				moment gave her a feeling of wrong-doing. She wanted to hurry back by the way they
				had come and start searching in the other direction. But at this moment Winston
				noticed some tufts of loosestrife growing in the cracks of the cliff beneath them.
				One tuft was of two colours, magenta and brick-red, apparently growing on the same
				root. He had never seen anything of the kind before, and he called to Katharine to
				come and look at it.

				<span data-line="4945"></span>She had already turned to go, but she did rather
				fretfully come back for a moment. She even leaned out over the cliff face to see
				where he was pointing. He was standing a little behind her, and he put his hand on
				her waist to steady her. At this moment it suddenly occurred to him how completely
				alone they were. There was not a human creature anywhere, not a leaf stirring, not
				even a bird awake. In a place like this the danger that there would be a hidden
				microphone was very small, and even if there was a microphone it would only pick up
				sounds. It was the hottest sleepiest hour of the afternoon. The sun blazed down upon
				them, the sweat tickled his face. And the thought struck him …

				<span data-line="4984"></span>He felt her shoulders give a wriggle of dissent. She
				always contradicted him when he said anything of this kind. She would not accept it

			<p class="p noindent" data-line="5034">
				<span data-line="5034"></span>Winston looked round the shabby little room above Mr
				Charrington<span data-line="5035"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5035"></span>s shop.
				Beside the window the enormous bed was made up, with ragged blankets and a coverless
				bolster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was ticking away on the
				mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gateleg table, the glass paperweight which he had
				bought on his last visit gleamed softly out of the half-darkness.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5042">
				<span data-line="5042"></span>In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan,
				and two cups, provided by Mr Charrington. Winston lit the burner and set a pan of
				water to boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and some saccharine
				tablets. The clock<span data-line="5045"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5045"></span>s
				hands said seventeen-twenty: it was nineteen-twenty really. She was coming at
				nineteen-thirty.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5049">
				<span data-line="5049"></span>Folly, folly, his heart kept saying: conscious,
				gratuitous, suicidal folly. Of all the crimes that a Party member could commit, this
				one was the least possible to conceal. Actually the idea had first floated into his
				head in the form of a vision, of the glass paperweight mirrored by the surface of
				the gateleg table. As he had foreseen, Mr Charrington had made no difficulty about
				letting the room. He was obviously glad of the few dollars that it would bring him.
				Nor did he seem shocked or become offensively knowing when it was made clear that
				Winston wanted the room for the purpose of a love-affair. Instead he looked into the
				middle distance and spoke in generalities, with so delicate an air as to give the
				impression that he had become partly invisible. Privacy, he said, was a very
				valuable thing. Everyone wanted a place where they could be alone occasionally. And
				when they had such a place, it was only common courtesy in anyone else who knew of
				it to keep his knowledge to himself. He even, seeming almost to fade out of
				existence as he did so, added that there were two entries to the house, one of them
				through the back yard, which gave on an alley.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5070">
				<span data-line="5070"></span>Under the window somebody was singing. Winston peeped
				out, secure in the protection of the muslin curtain. The June sun was still high in
				the sky, and in the sun-filled court below, a monstrous woman, solid as a Norman
				pillar, with brawny red forearms and a sacking apron strapped about her middle, was
				stumping to and fro between a washtub and a clothes line, pegging out a series of
				square white things which Winston recognized as babies<span data-line="5077"></span
				>_<span data-line="5077"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5077"></span>
				diapers. Whenever her mouth was not corked with clothes pegs she was singing in a
				powerful contralto:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="para-block pre-indented"
				data-line="5081"
				style="display: block"
			><code>         It was only an &#39;_opeless fancy.
         It passed like an Ipril dye,
         But a look an_&#39; a word an_&#39; the dreams they stirred!
         They &#39;ave stolen my &#39;_eart awye!</code></pre>
			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="5086">
				<span data-line="5086"></span>The tune had been haunting London for weeks past. It
				was one of countless similar songs published for the benefit of the proles by a
				sub-section of the Music Department. The words of these songs were composed without
				any human intervention whatever on an instrument known as a versificator. But the
				woman sang so tunefully as to turn the dreadful rubbish into an almost pleasant
				sound. He could hear the woman singing and the scrape of her shoes on the
				flagstones, and the cries of the children in the street, and somewhere in the far
				distance a faint roar of traffic, and yet the room seemed curiously silent, thanks
				to the absence of a telescreen.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5098">
				<span data-line="5098"></span>Folly, folly, folly! he thought again. It was
				inconceivable that they could frequent this place for more than a few weeks without
				being caught. But the temptation of having a hiding-place that was truly their own,
				indoors and near at hand, had been too much for both of them. For some time after
				their visit to the church belfry it had been impossible to arrange meetings. Working
				hours had been drastically increased in anticipation of Hate Week. It was more than
				a month distant, but the enormous, complex preparations that it entailed were
				throwing extra work on to everybody. Finally both of them managed to secure a free
				afternoon on the same day. They had agreed to go back to the clearing in the wood.
				On the evening beforehand they met briefly in the street. As usual, Winston hardly
				looked at Julia as they drifted towards one another in the crowd, but from the short
				glance he gave her it seemed to him that she was paler than usual.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="5126">
				<span data-line="5126"></span>For a moment he was violently angry. During the month
				that he had known her the nature of his desire for her had changed. At the beginning
				there had been little true sensuality in it. Their first love-making had been simply
				an act of the will. But after the second time it was different. The smell of her
				hair, the taste of her mouth, the feeling of her skin seemed to have got inside him,
				or into the air all round him. She had become a physical necessity, something that
				he not only wanted but felt that he had a right to. When she said that she could not
				come, he had the feeling that she was cheating him. But just at this moment the
				crowd pressed them together and their hands accidentally met. She gave the tips of
				his fingers a quick squeeze that seemed to invite not desire but affection. It
				struck him that when one lived with a woman this particular disappointment must be a
				normal, recurring event; and a deep tenderness, such as he had not felt for her
				before, suddenly took hold of him. He wished that they were a married couple of ten
				years<span data-line="5143"></span>_<span data-line="5143"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="5143"
				></span>
				standing. He wished that he were walking through the streets with her just as they
				were doing now but openly and without fear, talking of trivialities and buying odds
				and ends for the household. He wished above all that they had some place where they
				could be alone together without feeling the obligation to make love every time they
				met. It was not actually at that moment, but at some time on the following day, that
				the idea of renting Mr Charrington<span data-line="5150"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="5150"
				></span
				>s room had occurred to him. When he suggested it to Julia she had agreed with
				unexpected readiness. Both of them knew that it was lunacy. It was as though they
				were intentionally stepping nearer to their graves. As he sat waiting on the edge of
				the bed he thought again of the cellars of the Ministry of Love. It was curious how
				that predestined horror moved in and out of one<span data-line="5156"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="5156"></span>s consciousness. There it lay, fixed in future
				times, preceding death as surely as 99 precedes 100. One could not avoid it, but one
				could perhaps postpone it: and yet instead, every now and again, by a conscious,
				wilful act, one chose to shorten the interval before it happened.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5163">
				<span data-line="5163"></span>At this moment there was a quick step on the stairs.
				Julia burst into the room. She was carrying a tool-bag of coarse brown canvas, such
				as he had sometimes seen her carrying to and fro at the Ministry. He started forward
				to take her in his arms, but she disengaged herself rather hurriedly, partly because
				she was still holding the tool-bag.

				<span data-line="5170"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Half a second,</em

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5175">
				<span data-line="5175"></span>She fell on her knees, threw open the bag, and tumbled
				out some spanners and a screwdriver that filled the top part of it. Underneath were
				a number of neat paper packets. The first packet that she passed to Winston had a
				strange and yet vaguely

				mysteriously in a crowded street, sniffed for an instant and then lost again.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="5223">
				<span data-line="5223"></span>Winston gazed abstractedly through the muslin curtain.
				Down in the yard the red-armed woman was still marching to and fro between the
				washtub and the line. She took two more pegs out of her mouth and sang with deep
				feeling:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="para-block pre-indented"

				style="display: block"
			><code>         They sye that time &#39;_eals all things,

			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="5233">
				<span data-line="5233"></span>She knew the whole drivelling song by heart, it
				seemed. Her voice floated upward with the sweet summer air, very tuneful, charged
				with a sort of happy melancholy. One had the feeling that she would have been
				perfectly content, if the June evening had been endless and the supply of clothes
				inexhaustible, to remain there for a thousand years, pegging out diapers and singing
				rubbish. It struck him as a curious fact that he had never heard a member of the
				Party singing alone and spontaneously. It would even have seemed slightly
				unorthodox, a dangerous eccentricity, like talking to oneself. Perhaps it was only
				when people were somewhere near the starvation level that they had anything to sing
				about.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="5246">
				<span data-line="5246"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You can turn round now,</em

			<p class="p indent" data-line="5248">
				<span data-line="5248"></span>He turned round, and for a second almost failed to
				recognize her. What he had actually expected was to see her naked. But she was not
				naked. The transformation that had happened was much more surprising than that. She
				had painted her face.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5254">
				<span data-line="5254"></span>She must have slipped into some shop in the
				proletarian quarters and bought herself a complete set of make-up materials. Her
				lips were deeply reddened, her cheeks rouged, her nose powdered; there was even a
				touch of something under the eyes to make them brighter. It was not very skilfully
				done, but Winston<span data-line="5259"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5259"></span>s
				standards in such matters were not high. He had never before seen or imagined a
				woman of the Party with cosmetics on her face. The improvement in her appearance was
				startling. With just a few dabs of colour in the right places she had become not
				only very much prettier, but, above all, far more feminine. Her short hair and
				boyish overalls merely added to the effect. As he took her in his arms a wave of
				synthetic violets flooded his nostrils. He remembered the half-darkness of a
				basement kitchen, and a woman<span data-line="5267"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="5267"

				>s cavernous mouth. It was the very same scent that she had used; but at the moment
				it did not seem to matter.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="5271">

				<span data-line="5273"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Yes, dear, scent too. And do you know what I&#39;m going to do next? I&#39;m

			<p class="p indent" data-line="5279">
				<span data-line="5279"></span>They flung their clothes off and climbed into the huge
				mahogany bed. It was the first time that he had stripped himself naked in her
				presence. Until now he had been too much ashamed of his pale and meagre body, with
				the varicose veins standing out on his calves and the discoloured patch over his
				ankle. There were no sheets, but the blanket they lay on was threadbare and smooth,
				and the size and springiness of the bed astonished both of them.
				<span data-line="5286"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>It&#39;s sure to be full of bugs, but who cares?</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="5287"></span> said Julia. One never saw a double bed
				nowadays, except in the homes of the proles. Winston had occasionally slept in one
				in his boyhood: Julia had never been in one before, so far as she could remember.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5292">
				<span data-line="5292"></span>Presently they fell asleep for a little while. When
				Winston woke up the hands of the clock had crept round to nearly nine. He did not
				stir, because Julia was sleeping with her head in the crook of his arm. Most of her
				make-up had transferred itself to his own face or the bolster, but a light stain of
				rouge still brought out the beauty of her cheekbone. A yellow ray from the sinking
				sun fell across the foot of the bed and lighted up the fireplace, where the water in
				the pan was boiling fast. Down in the yard the woman had stopped singing, but the
				faint shouts of children floated in from the street. He wondered vaguely whether in
				the abolished past it had been a normal experience to lie in bed like this, in the
				cool of a summer evening, a man and a woman with no clothes on, making love when
				they chose, talking of what they chose, not feeling any compulsion to get up, simply
				lying there and listening to peaceful sounds outside. Surely there could never have
				been a time when that seemed ordinary? Julia woke up, rubbed her eyes, and raised
				herself on her elbow to look at the oilstove.

				<span data-line="5320"></span>She suddenly twisted herself over in the bed, seized a

			<p class="p indent" data-line="5350">
				<span data-line="5350"></span>She pressed herself against him and wound her limbs
				round him, as though to reassure him with the warmth of her body. He did not reopen
				his eyes immediately. For several moments he had had the feeling of being back in a
				nightmare which had recurred from time to time throughout his life. It was always
				very much the same. He was standing in front of a wall of darkness, and on the other
				side of it there was something unendurable, something too dreadful to be faced. In
				the dream his deepest feeling was always one of self-deception, because he did in
				fact know what was behind the wall of darkness. With a deadly effort, like wrenching
				a piece out of his own brain, he could even have dragged the thing into the open. He
				always woke up without discovering what it was: but somehow it was connected with
				what Julia had been saying when he cut her short.

				<span data-line="5373"></span>Already the black instant of panic was half-forgotten.
				Feeling slightly ashamed of himself, he sat up against the bedhead. Julia got out of
				bed, pulled on her overalls, and made the coffee. The smell that rose from the
				saucepan was so powerful and exciting that they shut the window lest anybody outside
				should notice it and become inquisitive. What was even better than the taste of the
				coffee was the silky texture given to it by the sugar, a thing Winston had almost
				forgotten after years of saccharine. With one hand in her pocket and a piece of
				bread and jam in the other, Julia wandered about the room, glancing indifferently at
				the bookcase, pointing out the best way of repairing the gateleg table, plumping
				herself down in the ragged arm-chair to see if it was comfortable, and examining the
				absurd twelve-hour clock with a sort of tolerant amusement. She brought the glass
				paperweight over to the bed to have a look at it in a better light. He took it out
				of her hand, fascinated, as always, by the soft, rainwatery appearance of the glass.

				the interior of the glass itself. There was such a depth of it, and yet it was
				almost as transparent as air. It was as though the surface of the glass had been the
				arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere complete. He had the
				feeling that he could get inside it, and that in fact he was inside it, along with
				the mahogany bed and the gateleg table, and the clock and the steel engraving and
				the paperweight itself. The paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was

				<span data-line="5465"></span>Syme had vanished. A morning came, and he was missing
				from work: a few thoughtless people commented on his absence. On the next day nobody
				mentioned him. On the third day Winston went into the vestibule of the Records
				Department to look at the notice-board. One of the notices carried a printed list of
				the members of the Chess Committee, of whom Syme had been one. It looked almost
				exactly as it had looked before — nothing had been crossed out — but it was one name

					data-line="5477"

				>s feet and the stench of the Tubes at the rush hours was a horror. The preparations
				for Hate Week were in full swing, and the staffs of all the Ministries were working
				overtime. Processions, meetings, military parades, lectures, waxworks, displays,
				film shows, telescreen programmes all had to be organized; stands had to be erected,
				effigies built, slogans coined, songs written, rumours circulated, photographs
				faked. Julia<span data-line="5484"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5484"></span>s unit
				in the Fiction Department had been taken off the production of novels and was
				rushing out a series of atrocity pamphlets. Winston, in addition to his regular
				work, spent long periods every day in going through back files of The Times and
				altering and embellishing news items which were to be quoted in speeches. Late at
				night, when crowds of rowdy proles roamed the streets, the town had a curiously
				febrile air. The rocket bombs crashed oftener than ever, and sometimes in the far
				distance there were enormous explosions which no one could explain and about which
				there were wild rumours.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="5496">
				<span data-line="5496"></span>The new tune which was to be the theme-song of Hate
				Week (the Hate Song, it was called) had already been composed and was being
				endlessly plugged on the telescreens. It had a savage, barking rhythm which could
				not exactly be called music, but resembled the beating of a drum. Roared out by
				hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying. The proles had
				taken a fancy to it, and in the midnight streets it competed with the still-popular

				a comb and a piece of toilet paper. Winston<span data-line="5506"></span>&#39;<span

				>s evenings were fuller than ever. Squads of volunteers, organized by Parsons, were
				preparing the street for Hate Week, stitching banners, painting posters, erecting
				flagstaffs on the roofs, and perilously slinging wires across the street for the
				reception of streamers. Parsons boasted that Victory Mansions alone would display
				four hundred metres of bunting. He was in his native element and as happy as a lark.
				The heat and the manual work had even given him a pretext for reverting to shorts
				and an open shirt in the evenings. He was everywhere at once, pushing, pulling,
				sawing, hammering, improvising, jollying everyone along with comradely exhortations
				and giving out from every fold of his body what seemed an inexhaustible supply of
				acrid-smelling sweat.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5520">
				<span data-line="5520"></span>A new poster had suddenly appeared all over London. It
				had no caption, and represented simply the monstrous figure of a Eurasian soldier,
				three or four metres high, striding forward with expressionless Mongolian face and
				enormous boots, a submachine gun pointed from his hip. From whatever angle you
				looked at the poster, the muzzle of the gun, magnified by the foreshortening, seemed
				to be pointed straight at you. The thing had been plastered on every blank space on
				every wall, even outnumbering the portraits of Big Brother. The proles, normally
				apathetic about the war, were being lashed into one of their periodical frenzies of
				patriotism. As though to harmonize with the general mood, the rocket bombs had been
				killing larger numbers of people than usual. One fell on a crowded film theatre in
				Stepney, burying several hundred victims among the ruins. The whole population of
				the neighbourhood turned out for a long, trailing funeral which went on for hours
				and was in effect an indignation meeting. Another bomb fell on a piece of waste
				ground which was used as a playground and several dozen children were blown to
				pieces. There were further angry demonstrations, Goldstein was burned in effigy,
				hundreds of copies of the poster of the Eurasian soldier were torn down and added to
				the flames, and a number of shops were looted in the turmoil; then a rumour flew
				round that spies were directing the rocket bombs by means of wireless waves, and an
				old couple who were suspected of being of foreign extraction had their house set on
				fire and perished of suffocation.

				>&#39;<span data-line="5547"></span>s shop, when they could get there, Julia and
				Winston lay side by side on a stripped bed under the open window, naked for the sake
				of coolness. The rat had never come back, but the bugs had multiplied hideously in
				the heat. It did not seem to matter. Dirty or clean, the room was paradise. As soon
				as they arrived they would sprinkle everything with pepper bought on the black
				market, tear off their clothes, and make love with sweating bodies, then fall asleep
				and wake to find that the bugs had rallied and were massing for the counter-attack.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5558">
				<span data-line="5558"></span>Four, five, six — seven times they met during the
				month of June. Winston had dropped his habit of drinking gin at all hours. He seemed
				to have lost the need for it. He had grown fatter, his varicose ulcer had subsided,
				leaving only a brown stain on the skin above his ankle, his fits of coughing in the
				early morning had stopped. The process of life had ceased to be intolerable, he had
				no longer any impulse to make faces at the telescreen or shout curses at the top of
				his voice. Now that they had a secure hiding-place, almost a home, it did not even
				seem a hardship that they could only meet infrequently and for a couple of hours at
				a time. What mattered was that the room over the junk-shop should exist. To know
				that it was there, inviolate, was almost the same as being in it. The room was a
				world, a pocket of the past where extinct animals could walk. Mr Charrington,
				thought Winston, was another extinct animal. He usually stopped to talk with Mr
				Charrington for a few minutes on his way upstairs. The old man seemed seldom or
				never to go out of doors, and on the other hand to have almost no customers. He led
				a ghostlike existence between the tiny, dark shop, and an even tinier back kitchen
				where he prepared his meals and which contained, among other things, an unbelievably
				ancient gramophone with an enormous horn. He seemed glad of the opportunity to talk.
				Wandering about among his worthless stock, with his long nose and thick spectacles
				and his bowed shoulders in the velvet jacket, he had always vaguely the air of being
				a collector rather than a tradesman. With a sort of faded enthusiasm he would finger
				this scrap of rubbish or that — a china bottle-stopper, the painted lid of a broken
				snuffbox, a pinchbeck locket containing a strand of some long-dead baby<span
					data-line="5586"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="5586"></span>s hair — never asking that Winston should buy
				it, merely that he should admire it. To talk to him was like listening to the
				tinkling of a worn-out musical-box. He had dragged out from the corners of his
				memory some more fragments of forgotten rhymes. There was one about four and twenty
				blackbirds, and another about a cow with a crumpled horn, and another about the

			<p class="p indent" data-line="5598">
				<span data-line="5598"></span>Both of them knew-in a way, it was never out of their
				minds that what was now happening could not last long. There were times when the
				fact of impending death seemed as palpable as the bed they lay on, and they would
				cling together with a sort of despairing sensuality, like a damned soul grasping at
				his last morsel of pleasure when the clock is within five minutes of striking. But
				there were also times when they had the illusion not only of safety but of
				permanence. So long as they were actually in this room, they both felt, no harm
				could come to them. Getting there was difficult and dangerous, but the room itself
				was sanctuary. It was as when Winston had gazed into the heart of the paperweight,
				with the feeling that it would be possible to get inside that glassy world, and that
				once inside it time could be arrested. Often they gave themselves up to daydreams of
				escape. Their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their intrigue,
				just like this, for the remainder of their natural lives. Or Katharine would die,
				and by subtle manoeuvrings Winston and Julia would succeed in getting married. Or
				they would commit suicide together. Or they would disappear, alter themselves out of
				recognition, learn to speak with proletarian accents, get jobs in a factory and live
				out their lives undetected in a back-street. It was all nonsense, as they both knew.
				In reality there was no escape. Even the one plan that was practicable, suicide,
				they had no intention of carrying out. To hang on from day to day and from week to
				week, spinning out a present that had no future, seemed an unconquerable instinct,
				just as one<span data-line="5624"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5624"></span>s lungs
				will always draw the next breath so long as there is air available.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5628">
				<span data-line="5628"></span>Sometimes, too, they talked of engaging in active
				rebellion against the Party, but with no notion of how to take the first step. Even
				if the fabulous Brotherhood was a reality, there still remained the difficulty of
				finding one<span data-line="5631"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5631"></span>s way
				into it. He told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or seemed to exist,
				between himself and O<span data-line="5633"></span>&#8216;Brien, and of the impulse
				he sometimes felt, simply to walk into O&#39;Brien&#39;s presence, announce that he
				was the enemy of the Party, and demand his help. Curiously enough, this did not
				strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do. She was used to judging people by
				their faces, and it seemed natural to her that Winston should believe O&#39;Brien to
				be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes. Moreover she took it
				for granted that everyone, or nearly everyone, secretly hated the Party and would
				break the rules if he thought it safe to do so. But she refused to believe that
				widespread, organized opposition existed or could exist. The tales about Goldstein
				and his underground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the Party had
				invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in. Times
				beyond number, at Party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations, she had shouted at
				the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and
				in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief. When public trials were
				happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the Youth League who
				surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals &#8217;<span
					data-line="5653"
				></span
				><em class="em-low1">Death to the traitors!</em
				><span data-line="5654"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5654"></span> During the Two
				Minutes Hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at Goldstein. Yet
				she had only the dimmest idea of who Goldstein was and what doctrines he was
				supposed to represent. She had grown up since the Revolution and was too young to
				remember the ideological battles of the fifties and sixties. Such a thing as an
				independent political movement was outside her imagination: and in any case the
				Party was invincible. It would always exist, and it would always be the same. You
				could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of
				violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5666">
				<span data-line="5666"></span>In some ways she was far more acute than Winston, and
				far less susceptible to Party propaganda. Once when he happened in some connexion to
				mention the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her
				opinion the war was not happening. The rocket bombs which fell daily on London were
				probably fired by the Government of Oceania itself,
				<span data-line="5671"></span>&#8216;_just to keep people frightened&#8217;<span
					data-line="5672"
				></span
				>. This was an idea that had literally never occurred to him. She also stirred a
				sort of envy in him by telling him that during the Two Minutes Hate her great
				difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing. But she only questioned the teachings
				of the Party when they in some way touched upon her own life. Often she was ready to
				accept the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and
				falsehood did not seem important to her. She believed, for instance, having learnt
				it at school, that the Party had invented aeroplanes. (In his own schooldays,
				Winston remembered, in the late fifties, it was only the helicopter that the Party
				claimed to have invented; a dozen years later, when Julia was at school, it was
				already claiming the aeroplane; one generation more, and it would be claiming the
				steam engine.) And when he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he
				was born and long before the Revolution, the fact struck her as totally
				uninteresting. After all, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes? It was
				rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she
				did not remember that Oceania, four years ago, had been at war with Eastasia and at
				peace with Eurasia. It was true that she regarded the whole war as a sham: but
				apparently she had not even noticed that the name of the enemy had changed.
				<span data-line="5695"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>I thought we&#39;d always been at war with Eurasia,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="5695"></span> she said vaguely. It frightened him a little.
				The invention of aeroplanes dated from long before her birth, but the switchover in
				the war had happened only four years ago, well after she was grown up. He argued
				with her about it for perhaps a quarter of an hour. In the end he succeeded in
				forcing her memory back until she did dimly recall that at one time Eastasia and not
				Eurasia had been the enemy. But the issue still struck her as unimportant.
				<span data-line="5703"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Who cares?</em>&#8217;<span

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5707">
				<span data-line="5707"></span>Sometimes he talked to her of the Records Department
				and the impudent forgeries that he committed there. Such things did not appear to
				horrify her. She did not feel the abyss opening beneath her feet at the thought of
				lies becoming truths. He told her the story of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford and
				the momentous slip of paper which he had once held between his fingers. It did not
				make much impression on her. At first, indeed, she failed to grasp the point of the
				story.

					only evidence is inside my own mind, and I don&#39;t know with any certainty

				one needed. If he persisted in talking of such subjects, she had a disconcerting
				habit of falling asleep. She was one of those people who can go to sleep at any hour
				and in any position. Talking to her, he realized how easy it was to present an
				appearance of orthodoxy while having no grasp whatever of what orthodoxy meant. In a
				way, the world-view of the Party imposed itself most successfully on people
				incapable of understanding it. They could be made to accept the most flagrant
				violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was
				demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice
				what was happening. By lack of understanding they remained sane. They simply
				swallowed everything, and what they swallowed did them no harm, because it left no
				residue behind, just as a grain of corn will pass undigested through the body of a

				<span data-line="5929"></span>He lay back with his eyes shut, still sodden in the
				atmosphere of the dream. It was a vast, luminous dream in which his whole life
				seemed to stretch out before him like a landscape on a summer evening after rain. It
				had all occurred inside the glass paperweight, but the surface of the glass was the
				dome of the sky, and inside the dome everything was flooded with clear soft light in
				which one could see into interminable distances. The dream had also been
				comprehended by — indeed, in some sense it had consisted in — a gesture of the arm
				made by his mother, and made again thirty years later by the Jewish woman he had
				seen on the news film, trying to shelter the small boy from the bullets, before the
				helicopter blew them both to pieces.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="5950">
				<span data-line="5950"></span>In the dream he had remembered his last glimpse of his
				mother, and within a few moments of waking the cluster of small events surrounding
				it had all come back. It was a memory that he must have deliberately pushed out of
				his consciousness over many years. He was not certain of the date, but he could not
				have been less than ten years old, possibly twelve, when it had happened.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5958">
				<span data-line="5958"></span>His father had disappeared some time earlier, how much
				earlier he could not remember. He remembered better the rackety, uneasy
				circumstances of the time: the periodical panics about air-raids and the sheltering
				in Tube stations, the piles of rubble everywhere, the unintelligible proclamations
				posted at street corners, the gangs of youths in shirts all the same colour, the
				enormous queues outside the bakeries, the intermittent machine-gun fire in the
				distance — above all, the fact that there was never enough to eat. He remembered
				long afternoons spent with other boys in scrounging round dustbins and rubbish
				heaps, picking out the ribs of cabbage leaves, potato peelings, sometimes even
				scraps of stale breadcrust from which they carefully scraped away the cinders; and
				also in waiting for the passing of trucks which travelled over a certain route and
				were known to carry cattle feed, and which, when they jolted over the bad patches in
				the road, sometimes spilt a few fragments of oil-cake.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5976">
				<span data-line="5976"></span>When his father disappeared, his mother did not show
				any surprise or any violent grief, but a sudden change came over her. She seemed to
				have become completely spiritless. It was evident even to Winston that she was
				waiting for something that she knew must happen. She did everything that was needed
				— cooked, washed, mended, made the bed, swept the floor, dusted the mantelpiece —
				always very slowly and with a curious lack of superfluous motion, like an
				artist<span data-line="5983"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5983"></span>s lay-figure
				moving of its own accord. Her large shapely body seemed to relapse naturally into
				stillness. For hours at a time she would sit almost immobile on the bed, nursing his
				young sister, a tiny, ailing, very silent child of two or three, with a face made
				simian by thinness. Very occasionally she would take Winston in her arms and press
				him against her for a long time without saying anything. He was aware, in spite of
				his youthfulness and selfishness, that this was somehow connected with the
				never-mentioned thing that was about to happen.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="5994">
				<span data-line="5994"></span>He remembered the room where they lived, a dark,
				closesmelling room that seemed half filled by a bed with a white counterpane. There
				was a gas ring in the fender, and a shelf where food was kept, and on the landing
				outside there was a brown earthenware sink, common to several rooms. He remembered
				his mother<span data-line="5999"></span>&#39;<span data-line="5999"></span>s
				statuesque body bending over the gas ring to stir at something in a saucepan. Above
				all he remembered his continuous hunger, and the fierce sordid battles at mealtimes.
				He would ask his mother naggingly, over and over again, why there was not more food,
				he would shout and storm at her (he even remembered the tones of his voice, which
				was beginning to break prematurely and sometimes boomed in a peculiar way), or he
				would attempt a snivelling note of pathos in his efforts to get more than his share.
				His mother was quite ready to give him more than his share. She took it for granted
				that he, <span data-line="6009"></span>&#8216;_the boy&#8217;<span
					data-line="6009"
				></span
				>, should have the biggest portion; but however much she gave him he invariably
				demanded more. At every meal she would beseech him not to be selfish and to remember
				that his little sister was sick and also needed food, but it was no use. He would
				cry out with rage when she stopped ladling, he would try to wrench the saucepan and
				spoon out of her hands, he would grab bits from his sister<span
					data-line="6015"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="6015"></span>s plate. He knew that he was starving the other
				two, but he could not help it; he even felt that he had a right to do it. The
				clamorous hunger in his belly seemed to justify him. Between meals, if his mother
				did not stand guard, he was constantly pilfering at the wretched store of food on
				the shelf.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6022">
				<span data-line="6022"></span>One day a chocolate-ration was issued. There had been
				no such issue for weeks or months past. He remembered quite clearly that precious
				little morsel of chocolate. It was a two-ounce slab (they still talked about ounces
				in those days) between the three of them. It was obvious that it ought to be divided
				into three equal parts. Suddenly, as though he were listening to somebody else,
				Winston heard himself demanding in a loud booming voice that he should be given the
				whole piece. His mother told him not to be greedy. There was a long, nagging
				argument that went round and round, with shouts, whines, tears, remonstrances,
				bargainings. His tiny sister, clinging to her mother with both hands, exactly like a
				baby monkey, sat looking over her shoulder at him with large, mournful eyes. In the
				end his mother broke off three-quarters of the chocolate and gave it to Winston,
				giving the other quarter to his sister. The little girl took hold of it and looked
				at it dully, perhaps not knowing what it was. Winston stood watching her for a
				moment. Then with a sudden swift spring he had snatched the piece of chocolate out
				of his sister<span data-line="6040"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6040"></span>s hand
				and was fleeing for the door.

				<span data-line="6043"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Winston, Winston!</em

				<span data-line="6043"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"

				>&#8217;<span data-line="6044"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6046">
				<span data-line="6046"></span>He stopped, but did not come back. His mother<span
					data-line="6046"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="6046"></span>s anxious eyes were fixed on his face. Even now
				he was thinking about the thing, he did not know what it was that was on the point
				of happening. His sister, conscious of having been robbed of something, had set up a
				feeble wail. His mother drew her arm round the child and pressed its face against
				her breast. Something in the gesture told him that his sister was dying. He turned
				and fled down the stairs. with the chocolate growing sticky in his hand.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6056">
				<span data-line="6056"></span>He never saw his mother again. After he had devoured
				the chocolate he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and hung about in the streets for
				several hours, until hunger drove him home. When he came back his mother had
				disappeared. This was already becoming normal at that time. Nothing was gone from
				the room except his mother and his sister. They had not taken any clothes, not even
				his mother<span data-line="6062"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6062"></span>s
				overcoat. To this day he did not know with any certainty that his mother was dead.
				It was perfectly possible that she had merely been sent to a forced-labour camp. As
				for his sister, she might have been removed, like Winston himself, to one of the
				colonies for homeless children (Reclamation Centres, they were called) which had
				grown up as a result of the civil war, or she might have been sent to the labour
				camp along with his mother, or simply left somewhere or other to die.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6072">
				<span data-line="6072"></span>The dream was still vivid in his mind, especially the
				enveloping protecting gesture of the arm in which its whole meaning seemed to be
				contained. His mind went back to another dream of two months ago. Exactly as his
				mother had sat on the dingy whitequilted bed, with the child clinging to her, so she
				had sat in the sunken ship, far underneath him, and drowning deeper every minute,
				but still looking up at him through the darkening water.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6081">
				<span data-line="6081"></span>He told Julia the story of his mother<span
					data-line="6081"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="6081"></span>s disappearance. Without opening her eyes she
				rolled over and settled herself into a more comfortable position.

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6090">
				<span data-line="6090"></span>From her breathing it was evident that she was going
				off to sleep again. He would have liked to continue talking about his mother. He did
				not suppose, from what he could remember of her, that she had been an unusual woman,
				still less an intelligent one; and yet she had possessed a kind of nobility, a kind
				of purity, simply because the standards that she obeyed were private ones. Her
				feelings were her own, and could not be altered from outside. It would not have
				occurred to her that an action which is ineffectual thereby becomes meaningless. If
				you loved someone, you loved him, and when you had nothing else to give, you still
				gave him love. When the last of the chocolate was gone, his mother had clasped the
				child in her arms. It was no use, it changed nothing, it did not produce more
				chocolate, it did not avert the child<span data-line="6103"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="6103"
				></span
				>s death or her own; but it seemed natural to her to do it. The refugee woman in the
				boat had also covered the little boy with her arm, which was no more use against the
				bullets than a sheet of paper. The terrible thing that the Party had done was to
				persuade you that mere impulses, mere feelings, were of no account, while at the
				same time robbing you of all power over the material world. When once you were in
				the grip of the Party, what you felt or did not feel, what you did or refrained from
				doing, made literally no difference. Whatever happened you vanished, and neither you
				nor your actions were ever heard of again. You were lifted clean out of the stream
				of history. And yet to the people of only two generations ago this would not have
				seemed all-important, because they were not attempting to alter history. They were
				governed by private loyalties which they did not question. What mattered were
				individual relationships, and a completely helpless gesture, an embrace, a tear, a
				word spoken to a dying man, could have value in itself. The proles, it suddenly
				occurred to him, had remained in this condition. They were not loyal to a party or a
				country or an idea, they were loyal to one another. For the first time in his life
				he did not despise the proles or think of them merely as an inert force which would
				one day spring to life and regenerate the world. The proles had stayed human. They
				had not become hardened inside. They had held on to the primitive emotions which he
				himself had to re-learn by conscious effort. And in thinking this he remembered,
				without apparent relevance, how a few weeks ago he had seen a severed hand lying on
				the pavement and had kicked it into the gutter as though it had been a
				cabbage-stalk.

				<span data-line="6187"></span>He thought of the telescreen with its never-sleeping
				ear. They could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your head you could
				still outwit them. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of
				finding out what another human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less true when
				you were actually in their hands. One did not know what happened inside the Ministry
				of Love, but it was possible to guess: tortures, drugs, delicate instruments that
				registered your nervous reactions, gradual wearing-down by sleeplessness and
				solitude and persistent questioning. Facts, at any rate, could not be kept hidden.
				They could be tracked down by enquiry, they could be squeezed out of you by torture.
				But if the object was not to stay alive but to stay human, what difference did it
				ultimately make? They could not alter your feelings: for that matter you could not
				alter them yourself, even if you wanted to. They could lay bare in the utmost detail
				everything that you had done or said or thought; but the inner heart, whose workings
				were mysterious even to yourself, remained impregnable.

				<span data-line="6211"></span>The room they were standing in was long-shaped and

				the pair of them, and the expression on his face was still indecipherable. He was
				waiting, somewhat sternly, for Winston to speak, but about what? Even now it was
				quite conceivable that he was simply a busy man wondering irritably why he had been
				interrupted. Nobody spoke. After the stopping of the telescreen the room seemed
				deadly silent. The seconds marched past, enormous. With difficulty Winston continued

				<span data-line="6307"></span>He paused, realizing for the first time the vagueness
				of his own motives. Since he did not in fact know what kind of help he expected from
				O<span data-line="6309"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6309"></span>Brien, it was not
				easy to say why he had come here. He went on, conscious that what he was saying must

			<p class="p indent" data-line="6322">
				<span data-line="6322"></span>He stopped and glanced over his shoulder, with the
				feeling that the door had opened. Sure enough, the little yellow-faced servant had
				come in without knocking. Winston saw that he was carrying a tray with a decanter
				and glasses.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="6333">
				<span data-line="6333"></span>The little man sat down, quite at his ease, and yet
				still with a servant-like air, the air of a valet enjoying a privilege. Winston
				regarded him out of the corner of his eye. It struck him that the man<span
					data-line="6336"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="6336"></span>s whole life was playing a part, and that he

				>&#39;<span data-line="6338"></span>Brien took the decanter by the neck and filled
				up the glasses with a dark-red liquid. It aroused in Winston dim memories of
				something seen long ago on a wall or a hoarding — a vast bottle composed of electric
				lights which seemed to move up and down and pour its contents into a glass. Seen
				from the top the stuff looked almost black, but in the decanter it gleamed like a
				ruby. It had a sour-sweet smell. He saw Julia pick up her glass and sniff at it with
				frank curiosity.

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6355">
				<span data-line="6355"></span>Winston took up his glass with a certain eagerness.
				Wine was a thing he had read and dreamed about. Like the glass paperweight or Mr
				Charrington<span data-line="6357"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6357"></span>s
				half-remembered rhymes, it belonged to the vanished, romantic past, the olden time
				as he liked to call it in his secret thoughts. For some reason he had always thought
				of wine as having an intensely sweet taste, like that of blackberry jam and an
				immediate intoxicating effect. Actually, when he came to swallow it, the stuff was
				distinctly disappointing. The truth was that after years of gin-drinking he could
				barely taste it. He set down the empty glass.

				flickered over their faces. There was not a trace of friendliness in his manner. He
				was memorizing their appearance, but he felt no interest in them, or appeared to
				feel none. It occurred to Winston that a synthetic face was perhaps incapable of
				changing its expression. Without speaking or giving any kind of salutation, Martin
				went out, closing the door silently behind him. O<span data-line="6491"></span

					are fighting for and the immediate tasks of the moment, you will never know
					anything. I tell you that the Brotherhood exists, but I cannot tell you whether
					it numbers a hundred members, or ten million. From your personal knowledge you
					will never be able to say that it numbers even as many as a dozen. You will have
					three or four contacts, who will be renewed from time to time as they disappear.
					As this was your first contact, it will be preserved. When you receive orders,
					they will come from me. If we find it necessary to communicate with you, it will
					be through Martin. When you are finally caught, you will confess. That is
					unavoidable. But you will have very little to confess, other than your own
					actions. You will not be able to betray more than a handful of unimportant

				In spite of the bulkiness of his body there was a remarkable grace in his movements.
				It came out even in the gesture with which he thrust a hand into his pocket, or
				manipulated a cigarette. More even than of strength, he gave an impression of
				confidence and of an understanding tinged by irony. However much in earnest he might
				be, he had nothing of the single-mindedness that belongs to a fanatic. When he spoke

					>You will have heard rumours of the existence of the Brotherhood. No doubt you
					have formed your own picture of it. You have imagined, probably, a huge
					underworld of conspirators, meeting secretly in cellars, scribbling messages on
					walls, recognizing one another by codewords or by special movements of the hand.
					Nothing of the kind exists. The members of the Brotherhood have no way of
					recognizing one another, and it is impossible for any one member to be aware of
					the identity of more than a few others. Goldstein himself, if he fell into the
					hands of the Thought Police, could not give them a complete list of members, or
					any information that would lead them to a complete list. No such list exists.
					The Brotherhood cannot be wiped out because it is not an organization in the
					ordinary sense. Nothing holds it together except an idea which is
					indestructible. You will never have anything to sustain you, except the idea.
					You will get no comradeship and no encouragement. When finally you are caught,
					you will get no help. We never help our members. At most, when it is absolutely
					necessary that someone should be silenced, we are occasionally able to smuggle a
					razor blade into a prisoner&#39;s cell. You will have to get used to living
					without results and without hope. You will work for a while, you will be caught,
					you will confess, and then you will die. Those are the only results that you
					will ever see. There is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen
					within our own lifetime. We are the dead. Our only true life is in the future.
					We shall take part in it as handfuls of dust and splinters of bone. But how far
					away that future may be, there is no knowing. It might be a thousand years. At

			<p class="p noindent" data-line="6690">
				<span data-line="6690"></span>Winston was gelatinous with fatigue. Gelatinous was
				the right word. It had come into his head spontaneously. His body seemed to have not
				only the weakness of a jelly, but its translucency. He felt that if he held up his
				hand he would be able to see the light through it. All the blood and lymph had been
				drained out of him by an enormous debauch of work, leaving only a frail structure of
				nerves, bones, and skin. All sensations seemed to be magnified. His overalls fretted
				his shoulders, the pavement tickled his feet, even the opening and closing of a hand
				was an effort that made his joints creak.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6701">
				<span data-line="6701"></span>He had worked more than ninety hours in five days. So
				had everyone else in the Ministry. Now it was all over, and he had literally nothing
				to do, no Party work of any description, until tomorrow morning. He could spend six
				hours in the hiding-place and another nine in his own bed. Slowly, in mild afternoon
				sunshine, he walked up a dingy street in the direction of Mr Charrington<span
					data-line="6707"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="6707"></span>s shop, keeping one eye open for the patrols,
				but irrationally convinced that this afternoon there was no danger of anyone
				interfering with him. The heavy brief-case that he was carrying bumped against his
				knee at each step, sending a tingling sensation up and down the skin of his leg.
				Inside it was the book, which he had now had in his possession for six days and had
				not yet opened, nor even looked at.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6716">
				<span data-line="6716"></span>On the sixth day of Hate Week, after the processions,
				the speeches, the shouting, the singing, the banners, the posters, the films, the
				waxworks, the rolling of drums and squealing of trumpets, the tramp of marching
				feet, the grinding of the caterpillars of tanks, the roar of massed planes, the
				booming of guns — after six days of this, when the great orgasm was quivering to its
				climax and the general hatred of Eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if
				the crowd could have got their hands on the 2,000 Eurasian war-criminals who were to
				be publicly hanged on the last day of the proceedings, they would unquestionably
				have torn them to pieces — at just this moment it had been announced that Oceania
				was not after all at war with Eurasia. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Eurasia was
				an ally.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6731">
				<span data-line="6731"></span>There was, of course, no admission that any change had
				taken place. Merely it became known, with extreme suddenness and everywhere at once,
				that Eastasia and not Eurasia was the enemy. Winston was taking part in a
				demonstration in one of the central London squares at the moment when it happened.
				It was night, and the white faces and the scarlet banners were luridly floodlit. The
				square was packed with several thousand people, including a block of about a
				thousand schoolchildren in the uniform of the Spies. On a scarlet-draped platform an
				orator of the Inner Party, a small lean man with disproportionately long arms and a
				large bald skull over which a few lank locks straggled, was haranguing the crowd. A
				little Rumpelstiltskin figure, contorted with hatred, he gripped the neck of the
				microphone with one hand while the other, enormous at the end of a bony arm, clawed
				the air menacingly above his head. His voice, made metallic by the amplifiers,
				boomed forth an endless catalogue of atrocities, massacres, deportations, lootings,
				rapings, torture of prisoners, bombing of civilians, lying propaganda, unjust
				aggressions, broken treaties. It was almost impossible to listen to him without
				being first convinced and then maddened. At every few moments the fury of the crowd
				boiled over and the voice of the speaker was drowned by a wild beast-like roaring
				that rose uncontrollably from thousands of throats. The most savage yells of all
				came from the schoolchildren. The speech had been proceeding for perhaps twenty
				minutes when a messenger hurried on to the platform and a scrap of paper was slipped
				into the speaker<span data-line="6757"></span>&#39;<span data-line="6757"></span>s
				hand. He unrolled and read it without pausing in his speech. Nothing altered in his
				voice or manner, or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names
				were different. Without words said, a wave of understanding rippled through the
				crowd. Oceania was at war with Eastasia! The next moment there was a tremendous
				commotion. The banners and posters with which the square was decorated were all
				wrong! Quite half of them had the wrong faces on them. It was sabotage! The agents
				of Goldstein had been at work! There was a riotous interlude while posters were
				ripped from the walls, banners torn to shreds and trampled underfoot. The Spies
				performed prodigies of activity in clambering over the rooftops and cutting the
				streamers that fluttered from the chimneys. But within two or three minutes it was
				all over. The orator, still gripping the neck of the microphone, his shoulders
				hunched forward, his free hand clawing at the air, had gone straight on with his
				speech. One minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the
				crowd. The Hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been
				changed.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6778">
				<span data-line="6778"></span>The thing that impressed Winston in looking back was
				that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence,
				not only without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax. But at the moment he
				had other things to preoccupy him. It was during the moment of disorder while the
				posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on
				the shoulder and said, <span data-line="6784"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Excuse me, I think you&#39;ve dropped your brief-case.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="6785"></span> He took the brief-case abstractedly, without
				speaking. He knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside
				it. The instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the Ministry of
				Truth, though the time was now nearly twenty-three hours. The entire staff of the
				Ministry had done likewise. The orders already issuing from the telescreen,
				recalling them to their posts, were hardly necessary.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6794">
				<span data-line="6794"></span>Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always
				been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years
				was now completely obsolete. Reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books,
				pamphlets, films, sound-tracks, photographs — all had to be rectified at lightning
				speed. Although no directive was ever issued, it was known that the chiefs of the
				Department intended that within one week no reference to the war with Eurasia, or
				the alliance with Eastasia, should remain in existence anywhere. The work was
				overwhelming, all the more so because the processes that it involved could not be
				called by their true names. Everyone in the Records Department worked eighteen hours
				in the twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of sleep. Mattresses were brought
				up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted of
				sandwiches and Victory Coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the
				canteen. Each time that Winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to
				leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he crawled back sticky-eyed and
				aching, it was to find that another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk
				like a snowdrift, halfburying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor, so
				that the first job was always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room
				to work. What was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical.
				Often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another, but any detailed
				report of events demanded care and imagination. Even the geographical knowledge that
				one needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was
				considerable.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6823">
				<span data-line="6823"></span>By the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his
				spectacles needed wiping every few minutes. It was like struggling with some
				crushing physical task, something which one had the right to refuse and which one
				was nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish. In so far as he had time to
				remember it, he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the
				speakwrite, every stroke of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie. He was as anxious
				as anyone else in the Department that the forgery should be perfect. On the morning
				of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down. For as much as half an hour
				nothing came out of the tube; then one more cylinder, then nothing. Everywhere at
				about the same time the work was easing off. A deep and as it were secret sigh went
				through the Department. A mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had been
				achieved. It was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence
				that the war with Eurasia had ever happened. At twelve hundred it was unexpectedly
				announced that all workers in the Ministry were free till tomorrow morning. Winston,
				still carrying the brief-case containing the book, which had remained between his
				feet while he worked and under his body while he slept, went home, shaved himself,
				and almost fell asleep in his bath, although the water was barely more than tepid.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6847">
				<span data-line="6847"></span>With a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he
				climbed the stair above Mr Charrington<span data-line="6848"></span>&#39;<span

				>s shop. He was tired, but not sleepy any longer. He opened the window, lit the
				dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee. Julia would arrive
				presently: meanwhile there was the book. He sat down in the sluttish armchair and
				undid the straps of the brief-case.

			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="6866">
				<span data-line="6866"></span>Winston began reading:

			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="6871">
				<span data-line="6871"></span>Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end
				of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High,
				the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne
				countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude
				towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of
				society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable
				changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will
				always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6883">
				<span data-line="6883"></span>The aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable…
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6885">
				<span data-line="6885"></span>Winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to
				appreciate the fact that he was reading, in comfort and safety. He was alone: no
				telescreen, no ear at the keyhole, no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or
				cover the page with his hand. The sweet summer air played against his cheek. From
				somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children: in the room itself
				there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock. He settled deeper into the
				arm-chair and put his feet up on the fender. It was bliss, it was etemity. Suddenly,
				as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read
				and re-read every word, he opened it at a different place and found himself at
				Chapter III. He went on reading:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6899">
				<span data-line="6899"></span>Chapter III War is Peace
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6902">
				<span data-line="6902"></span>The splitting up of the world into three great
				super-states was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle
				of the twentieth century. With the absorption of Europe by Russia and of the British
				Empire by the United States, two of the three existing powers, Eurasia and Oceania,
				were already effectively in being. The third, Eastasia, only emerged as a distinct
				unit after another decade of confused fighting. The frontiers between the three
				super-states are in some places arbitrary, and in others they fluctuate according to
				the fortunes of war, but in general they follow geographical lines. Eurasia
				comprises the whole of the northern part of the European and Asiatic land-mass, from
				Portugal to the Bering Strait. Oceania comprises the Americas, the Atlantic islands
				including the British Isles, Australasia, and the southern portion of Africa.
				Eastasia, smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier,
				comprises China and the countries to the south of it, the Japanese islands and a
				large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6922">
				<span data-line="6922"></span>In one combination or another, these three
				super-states are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five
				years. War, however, is no longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was
				in the early decades of the twentieth centary. It is a warfare of limited aims
				between combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause for
				fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference. This is not to
				say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing attitude towards it, has
				become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous. On the contrary, war hysteria is
				continuous and universal in all countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the
				slaughter of children, the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals
				against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as
				normal, and, when they are committed by one<span data-line="6937"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="6937"
				></span
				>s own side and not by the enemy, meritorious. But in a physical sense war involves
				very small numbers of people, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes
				comparatively few casualties. The fighting, when there is any, takes place on the
				vague frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round the
				Floating Fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes. In the centres of
				civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods, and
				the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths. War
				has in fact changed its character. More exactly, the reasons for which war is waged
				have changed in their order of importance. Motives which were already present to
				some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth centuary have now become
				dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="6953">
				<span data-line="6953"></span>To understand the nature of the present war — for in
				spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always the same war —
				one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive.
				None of the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other two
				in combination. They are too evenly matched, and their natural defences are too
				formidable. Eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces. Oceania by the width of
				the Atlantic and the Pacific, Eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its
				inhabitants. Secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight
				about. With the establishment of self-contained economies, in which production and
				consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main
				cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials
				is no longer a matter of life and death. In any case each of the three super-states
				is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own
				boundaries. In so far as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for
				labour power. Between the frontiers of the super-states, and not permanently in the
				possession of any of them, there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at
				Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong, containing within it about a fifth of
				the population of the earth. It is for the possession of these thickly-populated
				regions, and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly
				struggling. In practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area.
				Portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the chance of seizing this
				or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes
				of alignment.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="6984">
				<span data-line="6984"></span>All of the disputed territories contain valuable
				minerals, and some of them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which
				in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods.
				But above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour. Whichever power
				controls equatorial Africa, or the countries of the Middle East, or Southern India,
				or the Indonesian Archipelago, disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of
				millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies. The inhabitants of these areas,
				reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves, pass continually from conqueror
				to conqueror, and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more
				armaments, to capture more territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more
				armaments, to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely. It should be noted
				that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas. The
				frontiers of Eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the Congo and the
				northern shore of the Mediterranean; the islands of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific
				are constantly being captured and recaptured by Oceania or by Eastasia; in Mongolia
				the dividing line between Eurasia and Eastasia is never stable; round the Pole all
				three powers lay claim to enormous territories which in fact are largely unihabited
				and unexplored: but the balance of power always remains roughly even, and the
				territory which forms the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate.
				Moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the Equator is not really
				necessary to the world<span data-line="7010"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="7010"
				></span
				>s economy. They add nothing to the wealth of the world, since whatever they produce
				is used for purposes of war, and the object of waging a war is always to be in a
				better position in which to wage another war. By their labour the slave populations
				allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up. But if they did not exist,
				the structure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself, would
				not be essentially different.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7019">
				<span data-line="7019"></span>The primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with
				the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not
				recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of
				the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of
				the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption
				goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even
				have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have
				become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work. The
				world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that
				existed before 1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to
				which the people of that period looked forward. In the early twentieth century, the
				vision of a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient — a
				glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete — was part of
				the consciousness of nearly every literate person. Science and technology were
				developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to assume that they would go
				on developing. This failed to happen, partly because of the impoverishment caused by
				a long series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific and technical
				progress depended on the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a
				strictly regimented society. As a whole the world is more primitive today than it
				was fifty years ago. Certain backward areas have advanced, and various devices,
				always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage, have been developed,
				but experiment and invention have largely stopped, and the ravages of the atomic war
				of the nineteen-fifties have never been fully repaired. Nevertheless the dangers
				inherent in the machine are still there. From the moment when the machine first made
				its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery,
				and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the
				machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and
				disease could be eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being
				used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process — by producing wealth
				which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute — the machine did raise the
				living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about
				fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth
				centuries.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7064">
				<span data-line="7064"></span>But it was also clear that an all-round increase in
				wealth threatened the destruction — indeed, in some sense was the destruction — of a
				hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to
				eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car
				or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of
				inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would
				confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which
				wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly
				distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in
				practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security
				were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied
				by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when
				once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged
				minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a
				hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance. To
				return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the
				twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted
				with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive
				throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained
				industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be
				dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7093">
				<span data-line="7093"></span>Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses
				in poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent
				during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of
				many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital
				equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from
				working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military
				weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made
				opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning
				without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they
				must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by
				continuous warfare.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7108">
				<span data-line="7108"></span>The essential act of war is destruction, not
				necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of
				shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of
				the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable,
				and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not
				actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour
				power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for
				example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred
				cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any
				material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating
				Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any
				surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice
				the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is
				a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an
				advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near
				the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance
				of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and
				another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner
				Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that
				he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the
				better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his
				private motor-car or helicopter — set him in a different world from a member of the
				Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in
				comparison with the submerged masses whom we call
				<span data-line="7139"></span>&#8216;_the proles&#8217;<span data-line="7139"></span
				>. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump
				of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time
				the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over
				of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7147">
				<span data-line="7147"></span>War, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary
				destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way. In principle
				it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building
				temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by
				producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them. But this would
				provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society.
				What is concerned here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant so
				long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the Party itself. Even the
				humblest Party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent
				within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and
				ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic
				triumph. In other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality
				appropriate to a state of war. It does not matter whether the war is actually
				happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether
				the war is going well or badly. All that is needed is that a state of war should
				exist. The splitting of the intelligence which the Party requires of its members,
				and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war, is now almost universal,
				but the higher up the ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes. It is precisely in
				the Inner Party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest. In his
				capacity as an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the Inner Party
				to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often be aware
				that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being waged for
				purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such knowledge is easily
				neutralized by the technique of doublethink. Meanwhile no Inner Party member wavers
				for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real, and that it is bound to
				end victoriously, with Oceania the undisputed master of the entire world.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7183">
				<span data-line="7183"></span>All members of the Inner Party believe in this coming
				conquest as an article of faith. It is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring
				more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power,
				or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon. The search for new weapons
				continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the
				inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet. In Oceania at the present
				day, Science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. In Newspeak there is no
				word for <span data-line="7192"></span>&#8216;_Science&#8217;<span
					data-line="7192"
				></span
				>. The empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the
				past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of Ingsoc. And even
				technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for
				the diminution of human liberty. In all the useful arts the world is either standing
				still or going backwards. The fields are cultivated with horse-ploughs while books
				are written by machinery. But in matters of vital importance — meaning, in effect,
				war and police espionage — the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least
				tolerated. The two aims of the Party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth
				and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought. There are
				therefore two great problems which the Party is concerned to solve. One is how to
				discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other is
				how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning
				beforehand. In so far as scientific research still continues, this is its subject
				matter. The scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor,
				studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions, gestures,
				and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of drugs, shock therapy,
				hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist, physicist, or biologist concerned
				only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of
				life. In the vast laboratories of the Ministry of Peace, and in the experimental
				stations hidden in the Brazilian forests, or in the Australian desert, or on lost
				islands of the Antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work. Some are
				concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise larger
				and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more and more
				impenetrable armour- plating; others search for new and deadlier gases, or for
				soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the
				vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all
				possible antibodies; others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way
				under the soil like a submarine under the water, or an aeroplane as independent of
				its base as a sailing-ship; others explore even remoter possibilities such as
				focusing the sun<span data-line="7231"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7231"></span>s
				rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, or producing
				artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth<span
					data-line="7234"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="7234"></span>s centre.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7236">
				<span data-line="7236"></span>But none of these projects ever comes anywhere near
				realization, and none of the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the
				others. What is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the
				atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are
				likely to discover. Although the Party, according to its habit, claims the invention
				for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, and were
				first used on a large scale about ten years later. At that time some hundreds of
				bombs were dropped on industrial centres, chiefly in European Russia, Western
				Europe, and North America. The effect was to convince the ruling groups of all
				countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society, and
				hence of their own power. Thereafter, although no formal agreement was ever made or
				hinted at, no more bombs were dropped. All three powers merely continue to produce
				atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all
				believe will come sooner or later. And meanwhile the art of war has remained almost
				stationary for thirty or forty years. Helicopters are more used than they were
				formerly, bombing planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles,
				and the fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable Floating
				Fortress; but otherwise there has been little development. The tank, the submarine,
				the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use.
				And in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the Press and on the telescreens,
				the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of thousands or even
				millions of men were often killed in a few weeks, have never been repeated.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7267">
				<span data-line="7267"></span>None of the three super-states ever attempts any
				manoeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat. When any large operation is
				undertaken, it is usually a surprise attack against an ally. The strategy that all
				three powers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following, is the
				same. The plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and well-timed strokes
				of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the
				rival states, and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on
				peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep. During this time
				rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots;
				finally they will all be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to
				make retaliation impossible. It will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with
				the remaining world-power, in preparation for another attack. This scheme, it is
				hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization. Moreover, no
				fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the Equator and the Pole: no
				invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken. This explains the fact that in some
				places the frontiers between the superstates are arbitrary. Eurasia, for example,
				could easily conquer the British Isles, which are geographically part of Europe, or
				on the other hand it would be possible for Oceania to push its frontiers to the
				Rhine or even to the Vistula. But this would violate the principle, followed on all
				sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity. If Oceania were to conquer the
				areas that used once to be known as France and Germany, it would be necessary either
				to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to
				assimilate a population of about a hundred million people, who, so far as technical
				development goes, are roughly on the Oceanic level. The problem is the same for all
				three super-states. It is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should
				be no contact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners and
				coloured slaves. Even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the
				darkest suspicion. War prisoners apart, the average citizen of Oceania never sets
				eyes on a citizen of either Eurasia or Eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge
				of foreign languages. If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover
				that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told
				about them is lies. The sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the
				fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate. It
				is therefore realized on all sides that however often Persia, or Egypt, or Java, or
				Ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except
				bombs.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7316">
				<span data-line="7316"></span>Under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but
				tacitly understood and acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three
				super-states are very much the same. In Oceania the prevailing philosophy is called
				Ingsoc, in Eurasia it is called Neo-Bolshevism, and in Eastasia it is called by a
				Chinese name usually translated as Death-Worship, but perhaps better rendered as
				Obliteration of the Self. The citizen of Oceania is not allowed to know anything of
				the tenets of the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate them as
				barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense. Actually the three philosophies
				are barely distinguishable, and the social systems which they support are not
				distinguishable at all. Everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same
				worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous
				warfare. It follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer one another,
				but would gain no advantage by doing so. On the contrary, so long as they remain in
				conflict they prop one another up, like three sheaves of corn. And, as usual, the
				ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they
				are doing. Their lives are dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it
				is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory.
				Meanwhile the fact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of
				reality which is the special feature of Ingsoc and its rival systems of thought.
				Here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that by becoming
				continuous war has fundamentally changed its character.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7345">
				<span data-line="7345"></span>In past ages, a war, almost by definition, was
				something that sooner or later came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or
				defeat. In the past, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human
				societies were kept in touch with physical reality. All rulers in all ages have
				tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could not
				afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency. So long
				as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other result generally held to be
				undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be serious. Physical facts could
				not be ignored. In philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two
				might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make
				four. Inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle
				for efficiency was inimical to illusions. Moreover, to be efficient it was necessary
				to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what
				had happened in the past. Newspapers and history books were, of course, always
				coloured and biased, but falsification of the kind that is practised today would
				have been impossible. War was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling
				classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards. While
				wars could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7370">
				<span data-line="7370"></span>But when war becomes literally continuous, it also
				ceases to be dangerous. When war is continuous there is no such thing as military
				necessity. Technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or
				disregarded. As we have seen, researches that could be called scientific are still
				carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming,
				and their failure to show results is not important. Efficiency, even military
				efficiency, is no longer needed. Nothing is efficient in Oceania except the Thought
				Police. Since each of the three super-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a
				separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely
				practised. Reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life — the
				need to eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or
				stepping out of top-storey windows, and the like. Between life and death, and
				between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a distinction, but that
				is all. Cut off from contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen of
				Oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which
				direction is up and which is down. The rulers of such a state are absolute, as the
				Pharaohs or the Caesars could not be. They are obliged to prevent their followers
				from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are
				obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; but
				once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape they
				choose.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7398">
				<span data-line="7398"></span>The war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of
				previous wars, is merely an imposture. It is like the battles between certain
				ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of
				hurting one another. But though it is unreal it is not meaningless. It eats up the
				surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere
				that a hierarchical society needs. War, it will be seen, is now a purely internal
				affair. In the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might
				recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did
				fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished. In our
				own day they are not fighting against one another at all. The war is waged by each
				ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or
				prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact. The
				very word <span data-line="7413"></span>&#8216;_war&#8217;<span
					data-line="7413"
				></span
				>, therefore, has become misleading. It would probably be accurate to say that by
				becoming continuous war has ceased to exist. The peculiar pressure that it exerted
				on human beings between the Neolithic Age and the early twentieth century has
				disappeared and been replaced by something quite different. The effect would be much
				the same if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree to
				live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries. For in that case
				each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever from the sobering
				influence of external danger. A peace that was truly permanent would be the same as
				a permanent war. This — although the vast majority of Party members understand it
				only in a shallower sense — is the inner meaning of the Party slogan: War is Peace.

				<span data-line="7429"></span>Winston stopped reading for a moment. Somewhere in
				remote distance a rocket bomb thundered. The blissful feeling of being alone with
				the forbidden book, in a room with no telescreen, had not worn off. Solitude and
				safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body,
				the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played
				upon his cheek. The book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him. In a
				sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction. It said
				what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered
				thoughts in order. It was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously
				more powerful, more systematic, less fear-ridden. The best books, he perceived, are
				those that tell you what you know already. He had just turned back to Chapter I when

				<span data-line="7483"></span>Throughout recorded time, and probably since the end
				of the Neolithic Age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the High,
				the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne
				countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude
				towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of
				society has never altered. Even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable
				changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will
				always return to equilibnum, however far it is pushed one way or the other

				<span data-line="7499"></span>He continued reading:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7501">
				<span data-line="7501"></span>The aims of these three groups are entirely
				irreconcilable. The aim of the High is to remain where they are. The aim of the
				Middle is to change places with the High. The aim of the Low, when they have an aim
				— for it is an abiding characteristic of the Low that they are too much crushed by
				drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily
				lives — is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall
				be equal. Thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines
				recurs over and over again. For long periods the High seem to be securely in power,
				but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief
				in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both. They are then
				overthrown by the Middle, who enlist the Low on their side by pretending to them
				that they are fighting for liberty and justice. As soon as they have reached their
				objective, the Middle thrust the Low back into their old position of servitude, and
				themselves become the High. Presently a new Middle group splits off from one of the
				other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again. Of the three
				groups, only the Low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims.
				It would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no
				progress of a material kind. Even today, in a period of decline, the average human
				being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago. But no advance in
				wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human
				equality a millimetre nearer. From the point of view of the Low, no historic change
				has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7532">
				<span data-line="7532"></span>By the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this
				pattern had become obvious to many observers. There then rose schools of thinkers
				who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality
				was the unalterable law of human life. This doctrine, of course, had always had its
				adherents, but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant
				change. In the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the
				doctrine specifically of the High. It had been preached by kings and aristocrats and
				by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had
				generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the
				grave. The Middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had always made use of
				such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity. Now, however, the concept of human
				brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command,
				but merely hoped to be so before long. In the past the Middle had made revolutions
				under the banner of equality, and then had<span data-line="7549"></span><br />
				<span data-line="7550"></span> established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one
				was overthrown. The new Middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand.
				Socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last
				link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, was
				still deeply infected by the Utopianism of past ages. But in each variant of
				Socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty and
				equality was more and more openly abandoned. The new movements which appeared in the
				middle years of the century, Ingsoc in Oceania, Neo-Bolshevism in Eurasia,
				Death-Worship, as it is commonly called, in Eastasia, had the conscious aim of
				perpetuating unfreedom and inequality. These new movements, of course, grew out of
				the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their ideology.
				But the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen
				moment. The familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more, and then stop. As
				usual, the High were to be turned out by the Middle, who would then become the High;
				but this time, by conscious strategy, the High would be able to maintain their
				position permanently.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7571">
				<span data-line="7571"></span>The new doctrines arose partly because of the
				accumulation of historical knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which
				had hardly existed before the nineteenth century. The cyclical movement of history
				was now intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it was
				alterable. But the principal, underlying cause was that, as early as the beginning
				of the twentieth century, human equality had become technically possible. It was
				still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to
				be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others; but there was
				no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth.
				In earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable.
				Inequality was the price of civilization. With the development of machine
				production, however, the case was altered. Even if it was still necessary for human
				beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for them to live at
				different social or economic levels. Therefore, from the point of view of the new
				groups who were on the point of seizing power, human equality was no longer an ideal
				to be striven after, but a danger to be averted. In more primitive ages, when a just
				and peaceful society was in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe
				it. The idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of
				brotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human
				imagination for thousands of years. And this vision had had a certain hold even on
				the groups who actually profited by each historical change. The heirs of the French,
				English, and American revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the
				rights of man, freedom of speech, equality before the law, and the like, and have
				even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent. But by the
				fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought
				were authoritarian. The earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment
				when it became realizable. Every new political theory, by whatever name it called
				itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation. And in the general hardening of
				outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in
				some cases for hundreds of years — imprisonment without trial, the use of war
				prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the use of
				hostages, and the deportation of whole populations-not only became common again, but
				were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and
				progressive.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7617">
				<span data-line="7617"></span>It was only after a decade of national wars, civil
				wars, revolutions, and counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that Ingsoc and
				its rivals emerged as fully worked-out political theories. But they had been
				foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which had
				appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world which would
				emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious. What kind of people would
				control this world had been equally obvious. The new aristocracy was made up for the
				most part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity
				experts, sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians. These
				people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the
				working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly
				industry and centralized government. As compared with their opposite numbers in past
				ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power,
				and, above all, more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing
				opposition. This last difference was cardinal. By comparison with that existing
				today, all the tyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient. The ruling
				groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to
				leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in
				what their subjects were thinking. Even the Catholic Church of the Middle Ages was
				tolerant by modern standards. Part of the reason for this was that in the past no
				government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance. The
				invention of print, however, made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the
				film and the radio carried the process further. With the development of television,
				and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit
				simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end. Every citizen,
				or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching, could be kept for
				twentyfour hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official
				propaganda, with all other channels of communication closed. The possibility of
				enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the State, but complete
				uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed for the first time.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7658">
				<span data-line="7658"></span>After the revolutionary period of the fifties and
				sixties, society regrouped itself, as always, into High, Middle, and Low. But the
				new High group, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what
				was needed to safeguard its position. It had long been realized that the only secure
				basis for oligarchy is collectivism. Wealth and privilege are most easily defended
				when they are possessed jointly. The so-called
				<span data-line="7665"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>abolition of private property</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="7665"></span> which took place in the middle years of the
				century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer hands than
				before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a group instead of a mass
				of individuals. Individually, no member of the Party owns anything, except petty
				personal belongings. Collectively, the Party owns everything in Oceania, because it
				controls everything, and disposes of the products as it thinks fit. In the years
				following the Revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost
				unopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization.
				It had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were expropriated, Socialism
				must follow: and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated. Factories,
				mines, land, houses, transport — everything had been taken away from them: and since
				these things were no longer private property, it followed that they must be public
				property. Ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier Socialist movement and inherited its
				phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in the Socialist programme; with
				the result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic inequality has been made
				permanent.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7687">
				<span data-line="7687"></span>But the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical
				society go deeper than this. There are only four ways in which a ruling group can
				fall from power. Either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently
				that the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented Middle
				group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to
				govern. These causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are
				present in some degree. A ruling class which could guard against all of them would
				remain in power permanently. Ultimately the determining factor is the mental
				attitude of the ruling class itself.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7699">
				<span data-line="7699"></span>After the middle of the present century, the first
				danger had in reality disappeared. Each of the three powers which now divide the
				world is in fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow
				demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert. The second
				danger, also, is only a theoretical one. The masses never revolt of their own
				accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as
				they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware
				that they are oppressed. The recurrent economic crises of past times were totally
				unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen, but other and equally large
				dislocations can and do happen without having political results, because there is no
				way in which discontent can become articulate. As fcr the problem of overproduction,
				which has been latent in our society since the development of machine technique, it
				is solved by the device of continuous warfare (see Chapter III), which is also
				useful in keying up public morale to the necessary pitch. From the point of view of
				our present rulers, therefore, the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a
				new group of able, under-employed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism
				and scepticism in their own ranks. The problem, that is to say, is educational. It
				is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group
				and of the larger executive group that lies immediately below it. The consciousness
				of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7727">
				<span data-line="7727"></span>Given this background, one could infer, if one did not
				know it already, the general structure of Oceanic society. At the apex of the
				pyramid comes Big Brother. Big Brother is infallible and all-powerful. Every
				success, every achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all
				knowledge, all wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directly from
				his leadership and inspiration. Nobody has ever seen Big Brother. He is a face on
				the hoardings, a voice on the telescreen. We may be reasonably sure that he will
				never die, and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born. Big
				Brother is the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world. His
				function is to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which
				are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization. Below Big
				Brother comes the Inner Party. its numbers limited to six millions, or something
				less than 2 per cent of the population of Oceania. Below the Inner Party comes the
				Outer Party, which, if the Inner Party is described as the brain of the State, may
				be justly likened to the hands. Below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually
				refer to as <span data-line="7746"></span>&#8216;_the proles&#8217;<span
					data-line="7747"
				></span
				>, numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population. In the terms of our earlier
				classification, the proles are the Low: for the slave population of the equatorial
				lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror, are not a permanent or
				necessary part of the structure.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7753">
				<span data-line="7753"></span>In principle, membership of these three groups is not
				hereditary. The child of Inner Party parents is in theory not born into the Inner
				Party. Admission to either branch of the Party is by examination, taken at the age
				of sixteen. Nor is there any racial discrimination, or any marked domination of one
				province by another. Jews, Negroes, South Americans of pure Indian blood are to be
				found in the highest ranks of the Party, and the administrators of any area are
				always drawn from the inhabitants of that area. In no part of Oceania do the
				inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled from a
				distant capital. Oceania has no capital, and its titular head is a person whose
				whereabouts nobody knows. Except that English is its chief lingua franca and
				Newspeak its official language, it is not centralized in any way. Its rulers are not
				held together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine. It is true that
				our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7771">
				<span data-line="7771"></span>what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines.
				There is far less to- and-fro movement between the different groups than happened
				under capitalism or even in the pre-industrial age. Between the two branches of the
				Party there is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much as will ensure that
				weaklings are excluded from the Inner Party and that ambitious members of the Outer
				Party are made harmless by allowing them to rise. Proletarians, in practice, are not
				allowed to graduate into the Party. The most gifted among them, who might possibly
				become nuclei of discontent, are simply marked down by the Thought Police and
				eliminated. But this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a
				matter of principle. The Party is not a class in the old sense of the word. It does
				not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there were no
				other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be perfectly prepared to
				recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat. In the crucial
				years, the fact that the Party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to
				neutralize opposition. The older kind of Socialist, who had been trained to fight
				against something called <span data-line="7791"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>class privilege</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="7791"></span>
				assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent. He did not see that the
				continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause to reflect that
				hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived, whereas adoptive organizations
				such as the Catholic Church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of
				years. The essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the
				persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead
				upon the living. A ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its
				successors. The Party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with
				perpetuating itself. Who wields power is not important, provided that the
				hierarchical structure remains always the same.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7806">
				<span data-line="7806"></span>All the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental
				attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of
				the Party and prevent the true nature of present-day society from being perceived.
				Physical rebellion, or any preliminary move towards rebellion, is at present not
				possible. From the proletarians nothing is to be feared. Left to themselves, they
				will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working,
				breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of
				grasping that the world could be other than it is. They could only become dangerous
				if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more
				highly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the
				level of popular education is actually declining. What opinions the masses hold, or
				do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference. They can be granted
				intellectual liberty because they have no intellect. In a Party member, on the other
				hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can
				be tolerated.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7826">
				<span data-line="7826"></span>A Party member lives from birth to death under the eye
				of the Thought Police. Even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone.
				Wherever he may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in his bath or in bed, he
				can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected.
				Nothing that he does is indifferent. His friendships, his relaxations, his behaviour
				towards his wife and children, the expression of his face when he is alone, the
				words he mutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements of his body, are all
				jealously scrutinized. Not only any actual misdemeanour, but any eccentricity,
				however small, any change of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be
				the symptom of an inner struggle, is certain to be detected. He has no freedom of
				choice in any direction whatever. On the other hand his actions are not regulated by
				law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour. In Oceania there is no law.
				Thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean certain death are not formally
				forbidden, and the endless purges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and
				vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been
				committed, but are merely the wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime
				at some time in the future. A Party member is required to have not only the right
				opinions, but the right instincts. Many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him
				are never plainly stated, and could not be stated without laying bare the
				contradictions inherent in Ingsoc. If he is a person naturally orthodox (in Newspeak
				a goodthinker), he will in all circumstances know, without taking thought, what is
				the true belief or the desirable emotion. But in any case an elaborate mental
				training, undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the Newspeak words
				crimestop, blackwhite, and doublethink, makes him unwilling and unable to think too
				deeply on any subject whatever.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7860">
				<span data-line="7860"></span>A Party member is expected to have no private emotions
				and no respites from enthusiasm. He is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of
				hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and
				self-abasement before the power and wisdom of the Party. The discontents produced by
				his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such
				devices as the Two Minutes Hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a
				sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner
				discipline. The first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even
				to young children, is called, in Newspeak, crimestop. Crimestop means the faculty of
				stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought. It
				includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors,
				of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to Ingsoc, and of
				being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a
				heretical direction. Crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity. But stupidity
				is not enough. On the contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over
				one<span data-line="7880"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7880"></span>s own mental
				processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body. Oceanic society
				rests ultimately on the belief that Big Brother is omnipotent and that the Party is
				infallible. But since in reality Big Brother is not omnipotent and the party is not
				infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the
				treatment of facts. The keyword here is blackwhite. Like so many Newspeak words,
				this word has two mutually contradictory meanings. Applied to an opponent, it means
				the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain
				facts. Applied to a Party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is
				white when Party discipline demands this. But it means also the ability to believe
				that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one
				has ever believed the contrary. This demands a continuous alteration of the past,
				made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which
				is known in Newspeak as doublethink.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7900">
				<span data-line="7900"></span>The alteration of the past is necessary for two
				reasons, one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary. The subsidiary
				reason is that the Party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day
				conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison. He must be cut off from
				the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is necessary
				for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average
				level of material comfort is constantly rising. But by far the more important reason
				for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the
				Party. It is not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be
				constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party
				were in all cases right. It is also that no change in doctrine or in political
				alignment can ever be admitted. For to change one<span data-line="7915"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="7915"></span>s mind, or even one<span data-line="7915"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="7915"></span>s policy, is a confession of weakness. If, for
				example, Eurasia or Eastasia (whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then that
				country must always have been the enemy. And if the facts say otherwise then the
				facts must be altered. Thus history is continuously rewritten. This day-to-day
				falsification of the past, carried out by the Ministry of Truth, is as necessary to
				the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by
				the Ministry of Love.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7925">
				<span data-line="7925"></span>The mutability of the past is the central tenet of
				Ingsoc. Past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in
				written records and in human memories. The past is whatever the records and the
				memories agree upon. And since the Party is in full control of all records and in
				equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is
				whatever the Party chooses to make it. It also follows that though the past is
				alterable, it never has been altered in any specific instance. For when it has been
				recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version is the
				past, and no different past can ever have existed. This holds good even when, as
				often happens, the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in
				the course of a year. At all times the Party is in possession of absolute truth, and
				clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now. It will be
				seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory. To
				make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely
				a mechanical act. But it is also necessary to remember that events happened in the
				desired manner. And if it is necessary to rearrange one<span data-line="7945"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="7945"></span>s memories or to tamper with written records,
				then it is necessary to forget that one has done so. The trick of doing this can be
				learned like any other mental technique. It is learned by the majority of Party
				members, and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox. In Oldspeak
				it is called, quite frankly, <span data-line="7951"></span>&#8216;_reality
				control&#8217;<span data-line="7951"></span>. In Newspeak it is called doublethink,
				though doublethink comprises much else as well.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7955">
				<span data-line="7955"></span>Doublethink means the power of holding two
				contradictory beliefs in one<span data-line="7956"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="7956"
				></span
				>s mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. The Party intellectual knows in
				which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is playing
				tricks with reality; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself
				that reality is not violated. The process has to be conscious, or it would not be
				carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it
				would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt. Doublethink lies at the
				very heart of Ingsoc, since the essential act of the Party is to use conscious
				deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty.
				To tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that
				has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back
				from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective
				reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies — all this
				is indispensably necessary. Even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to
				exercise doublethink. For by using the word one admits that one is tampering with
				reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on
				indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth. Ultimately it is by
				means of doublethink that the Party has been able — and may, for all we know,
				continue to be able for thousands of years — to arrest the course of history.

				<span data-line="7983"></span>All past oligarchies have fallen from power either
				because they ossified or because they grew soft. Either they became stupid and
				arrogant, failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances, and were
				overthrown; or they became liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should
				have used force, and once again were overthrown. They fell, that is to say, either
				through consciousness or through unconsciousness. It is the achievement of the Party
				to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist
				simultaneously. And upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the Party
				be made permanent. If one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to
				dislocate the sense of reality. For the secret of rulership is to combine a belief
				in one<span data-line="7995"></span>&#39;<span data-line="7995"></span>s own
				infallibility with the Power to learn from past mistakes.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="7998">
				<span data-line="7998"></span>It need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners
				of doublethink are those who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system
				of mental cheating. In our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is
				happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is. In
				general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion; the more
				intelligent, the less sane. One clear illustration of this is the fact that war
				hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social scale. Those whose
				attitude towards the war is most nearly rational are the subject peoples of the
				disputed territories. To these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which
				sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tidal wave. Which side is winning is a
				matter of complete indifference to them. They are aware that a change of
				overlordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new
				masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones. The slightly more
				favoured workers whom we call <span data-line="8015"></span>&#8216;<em
					class="em-low1"
					>the proles</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="8015"></span>
				are only intermittently conscious of the war. When it is necessary they can be
				prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, but when left to themselves they are
				capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening. It is in the ranks
				of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, that the true war enthusiasm is
				found. World-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be
				impossible. This peculiar linking-together of opposites — knowledge with ignorance,
				cynicism with fanaticism-is one of the chief distinguishing marks of Oceanic
				society. The official ideology abounds with contradictions even when there is no
				practical reason for them. Thus, the Party rejects and vilifies every principle for
				which the Socialist movement originally stood, and it chooses to do this in the name
				of Socialism. It preaches a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries
				past, and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to
				manual workers and was adopted for that reason. It systematically undermines the
				solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal
				to the sentiment of family loyalty. Even the names of the four Ministries by which
				we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the
				facts. The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with
				lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.
				These contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy;
				they are deliberate exercises in doublethink. For it is only by reconciling
				contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely. In no other way could the
				ancient cycle be broken. If human equality is to be for ever averted — if the High,
				as we have called them, are to keep their places permanently — then the prevailing
				mental condition must be controlled insanity.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8049">
				<span data-line="8049"></span>But there is one question which until this moment we
				have almost ignored. It is; why should human equality be averted? Supposing that the
				mechanics of the process have been rightly described, what is the motive for this
				huge, accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time?
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8056">
				<span data-line="8056"></span>Here we reach the central secret. As we have seen. the
				mystique of the Party, and above all of the Inner Party, depends upon doublethink.
				But deeper than this lies the original motive, the never-questioned instinct that
				first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink, the Thought Police,
				continuous warfare, and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence
				afterwards. This motive really consists … Winston became aware of silence, as one
				becomes aware of a new sound. It seemed to him that Julia had been very still for
				some time past. She was lying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her
				cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes. Her breast
				rose and fell slowly and regularly.

				before that he was not mad. Being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not

			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="8128">
				<span data-line="8128"></span>As he fastened the belt of his overalls he strolled
				across to the window. The sun must have gone down behind the houses; it was not
				shining into the yard any longer. The flagstones were wet as though they had just
				been washed, and he had the feeling that the sky had been washed too, so fresh and
				pale was the blue between the chimney-pots. Tirelessly the woman marched to and fro,
				corking and uncorking herself, singing and falling silent, and pegging out more
				diapers, and more and yet more. He wondered whether she took in washing for a living
				or was merely the slave of twenty or thirty grandchildren. Julia had come across to
				his side; together they gazed down with a sort of fascination at the sturdy figure
				below. As he looked at the woman in her characteristic attitude, her thick arms
				reaching up for the line, her powerful mare-like buttocks protruded, it struck him
				for the first time that she was beautiful. It had never before occurred to him that
				the body of a woman of fifty, blown up to monstrous dimensions by childbearing, then
				hardened, roughened by work till it was coarse in the grain like an over-ripe
				turnip, could be beautiful. But it was so, and after all, he thought, why not? The
				solid, contourless body, like a block of granite, and the rasping red skin, bore the
				same relation to the body of a girl as the rose-hip to the rose. Why should the
				fruit be held inferior to the flower?
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8152">
				<span data-line="8152"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">She&#39;s beautiful,</em

				<span data-line="8156"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>That is her style of beauty,</em

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8158">
				<span data-line="8158"></span>He held Julia<span data-line="8158"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="8158"
				></span
				>s supple waist easily encircled by his arm. From the hip to the knee her flank was
				against his. Out of their bodies no child would ever come. That was the one thing
				they could never do. Only by word of mouth, from mind to mind, could they pass on
				the secret. The woman down there had no mind, she had only strong arms, a warm
				heart, and a fertile belly. He wondered how many children she had given birth to. It
				might easily be fifteen. She had had her momentary flowering, a year, perhaps, of
				wild-rose beauty and then she had suddenly swollen like a fertilized fruit and grown
				hard and red and coarse, and then her life had been laundering, scrubbing, darning,
				cooking, sweeping, polishing, mending, scrubbing, laundering, first for children,
				then for grandchildren, over thirty unbroken years. At the end of it she was still
				singing. The mystical reverence that he felt for her was somehow mixed up with the
				aspect of the pale, cloudless sky, stretching away behind the chimney-pots into
				interminable distance. It was curious to think that the sky was the same for
				everybody, in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were
				also very much the same — everywhere, all over the world, hundreds of thousands of
				millions of people just like this, people ignorant of one another<span
					data-line="8179"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="8179"></span>s existence, held apart by walls of hatred and
				lies, and yet almost exactly the same — people who had never learned to think but
				who were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one
				day overturn the world. If there was hope, it lay in the proles! Without having read
				to the end of the book, he knew that that must be Goldstein<span
					data-line="8185"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="8185"></span>s final message. The future belonged to the
				proles. And could he be sure that when their time came the world they constructed
				would not be just as alien to him, Winston Smith, as the world of the Party? Yes,
				because at the least it would be a world of sanity. Where there is equality there
				can be sanity. Sooner or later it would happen, strength would change into
				consciousness. The proles were immortal, you could not doubt it when you looked at
				that valiant figure in the yard. In the end their awakening would come. And until
				that happened, though it might be a thousand years, they would stay alive against
				all the odds, like birds, passing on from body to body the vitality which the Party
				did not share and could not kill.

				floor, fighting for breath. Winston dared not turn his head even by a millimetre,
				but sometimes her livid, gasping face came within the angle of his vision. Even in
				his terror it was as though he could feel the pain in his own body, the deadly pain
				which nevertheless was less urgent than the struggle to get back her breath. He knew
				what it was like; the terrible, agonizing pain which was there all the while but
				could not be suffered yet, because before all else it was necessary to be able to
				breathe. Then two of the men hoisted her up by knees and shoulders, and carried her
				out of the room like a sack. Winston had a glimpse of her face, upside down, yellow
				and contorted, with the eyes shut, and still with a smear of rouge on either cheek;
				and that was the last he saw of her.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="8317">
				<span data-line="8317"></span>He stood dead still. No one had hit him yet. Thoughts
				which came of their own accord but seemed totally uninteresting began to flit
				through his mind. He wondered whether they had got Mr Charrington. He wondered what
				they had done to the woman in the yard. He noticed that he badly wanted to urinate,
				and felt a faint surprise, because he had done so only two or three hours ago. He
				noticed that the clock on the mantelpiece said nine, meaning twenty-one. But the
				light seemed too strong. Would not the light be fading at twenty-one hours on an
				August evening? He wondered whether after all he and Julia had mistaken the time —
				had slept the clock round and thought it was twenty-thirty when really it was nought
				eight-thirty on the following morning. But he did not pursue the thought further. It
				was not interesting.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8332">
				<span data-line="8332"></span>There ws another, lighter step in the passage. Mr
				Charrington came into the room. The demeanour of the black-uniformed men suddenly
				became more subdued. Something had also changed in Mr Charrington<span
					data-line="8335"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="8335"></span>s appearance. His eye fell on the fragments of
				the glass paperweight.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8338">
				<span data-line="8338"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Pick up those pieces,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="8338"></span> he said sharply.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8340">
				<span data-line="8340"></span>A man stooped to obey. The cockney accent had
				disappeared; Winston suddenly realized whose voice it was that he had heard a few
				moments ago on the telescreen. Mr Charrington was still wearing his old velvet
				jacket, but his hair, which had been almost white, had turned black. Also he was not
				wearing his spectacles. He gave Winston a single sharp glance, as though verifying
				his identity, and then paid no more attention to him. He was still recognizable, but
				he was not the same person any longer. His body had straightened, and seemed to have
				grown bigger. His face had undergone only tiny changes that had nevertheless worked
				a complete transformation. The black eyebrows were less bushy, the wrinkles were
				gone, the whole lines of the face seemed to have altered; even the nose seemed
				shorter. It was the alert, cold face of a man of about five-and-thirty. It occurred
				to Winston that for the first time in his life he was looking, with knowledge, at a
				member of the Thought Police.

			<p class="p noindent" data-line="8360">
				<span data-line="8360"></span>He did not know where he was. Presumably he was in the
				Ministry of Love, but there was no way of making certain. He was in a high-ceilinged
				windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps flooded it
				with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound which he supposed had
				something to do with the air supply. A bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit on
				ran round the wall, broken only by the door and, at the end opposite the door, a
				lavatory pan with no wooden seat. There were four telescreens, one in each wall.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8371">
				<span data-line="8371"></span>There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been
				there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away. But
				he was also hungry, with a gnawing, unwholesome kind of hunger. It might be
				twenty-four hours since he had eaten, it might be thirty-six. He still did not know,
				probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested
				him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8379">
				<span data-line="8379"></span>He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with
				his hands crossed on his knee. He had already learned to sit still. If you made
				unexpected movements they yelled at you from the telescreen. But the craving for
				food was growing upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread. He had
				an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls. It was even
				possible — he thought this because from time to time something seemed to tickle his
				leg — that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there. In the end the temptation
				to find out overcame his fear; he slipped a hand into his pocket.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="8391">
				<span data-line="8391"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Smith!</em>&#8217;<span

				>&#8217;<span data-line="8392"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8394">
				<span data-line="8394"></span>He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee.
				Before being brought here he had been taken to another place which must have been an
				ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how long
				he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no daylight it was
				hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling place. They had put him into a
				cell similar to the one he was now in, but filthily dirty and at all times crowded
				by ten or fifteen people. The majority of them were common criminals, but there were
				a few political prisoners among them. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by
				dirty bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much
				interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference in
				demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Party prisoners were
				always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for
				anybody. They yelled insults at the guards, fought back fiercely when their
				belongings were impounded, wrote obscene words on the floor, ate smuggled food which
				they produced from mysterious hiding-places in their clothes, and even shouted down
				the telescreen when it tried to restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed
				to be on good terms with the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle
				cigarettes through the spyhole in the door. The guards, too, treated the common
				criminals with a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle them roughly.
				There was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which most of the prisoners
				expected to be sent. It was <span data-line="8421"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>all right</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="8421"></span> in the camps, he gathered, so long as you had
				good contacts and knew the ropes. There was bribery, favouritism, and racketeering
				of every kind, there was homosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit
				alcohol distilled from potatoes. The positions of trust were given only to the
				common criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort of
				aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8430">
				<span data-line="8430"></span>There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every
				description: drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes.
				Some of the drunks were so violent<span data-line="8432"></span><br />
				<span data-line="8433"></span> that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress
				them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with great tumbling breasts
				and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles, was carried in,
				kicking and shouting, by four guards, who had hold of her one at each corner. They
				wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her
				down across Winston<span data-line="8439"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8439"></span
				>s lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. The woman hoisted herself upright and
				followed them out with a yell of <span data-line="8441"></span>&#8216;<em
					class="em-low1"
					>F— bastards!</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="8441"></span> Then, noticing that she was sitting on

				<span data-line="8452"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Thass better,</em

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8456">
				<span data-line="8456"></span>She revived, turned to have another look at Winston
				and seemed immediately to take a fancy to him. She put a vast arm round his shoulder

				<span data-line="8465"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Smith?</em>&#8217;<span

					>Thass funny. My name&#39;s Smith too. Why,</em

				>&#8217;<span data-line="8466"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8468">
				<span data-line="8468"></span>She might, thought Winston, be his mother. She was
				about the right age and physique, and it was probable that people changed somewhat
				after twenty years in a forced-labour camp.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8472">
				<span data-line="8472"></span>No one else had spoken to him. To a surprising extent
				the ordinary criminals ignored the Party prisoners.
				<span data-line="8473"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">The polits,</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="8473"></span> they called them, with a sort of uninterested
				contempt. The Party prisoners seemed terrified of speaking to anybody, and above all
				of speaking to one another. Only once, when two Party members, both women, were
				pressed close together on the bench, he overheard amid the din of voices a few
				hurriedly-whispered words; and in particular a reference to something called
				<span data-line="8479"></span>&#8216;_room one-oh-one&#8217;<span
					data-line="8480"
				></span
				>, which he did not understand.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8482">
				<span data-line="8482"></span>It might be two or three hours ago that they had
				brought him here. The dull pain in his belly never went away, but sometimes it grew
				better and sometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly.
				When it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for food.
				When it grew better, panic took hold of him. There were moments when he foresaw the
				things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped and his
				breath stopped. He felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on
				his shins; he saw himself grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through
				broken teeth. He hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his mind on her. He loved
				her and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the rules
				of arithmetic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered what was
				happening to her. He thought oftener of O<span data-line="8497"></span>&#8216;Brien,
				with a flickering hope. O&#39;Brien might know that he had been arrested. The
				Brotherhood, he had said, never tried to save its members. But there was the razor
				blade; they would send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps five
				seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The blade would bite into him
				with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that held it would be cut to
				the bone. Everything came back to his sick body, which shrank trembling from the
				smallest pain. He was not certain that he would use the razor blade even if he got
				the chance. It was more natural to exist from moment to moment, accepting another
				ten minutes_&#8217;<span data-line="8507"></span> life even with the certainty that
				there was torture at the end of it.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8510">
				<span data-line="8510"></span>Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of
				porcelain bricks in the walls of the cell. It should have been easy, but he always
				lost count at some point or another. More often he wondered where he was, and what
				time of day it was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight
				outside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In this place,
				he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out. It was the place with
				no darkness: he saw now why O<span data-line="8517"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="8517"
				></span
				>Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion. In the Ministry of Love there were no
				windows. His cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall;
				it might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved himself mentally
				from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he
				was perched high in the air or buried deep underground.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8526">
				<span data-line="8526"></span>There was a sound of marching boots outside. The steel
				door opened with a clang. A young officer, a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed
				to glitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale, straight-featured face
				was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned to the guards
				outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The poet Ampleforth shambled
				into the cell. The door clanged shut again.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8535">
				<span data-line="8535"></span>Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from
				side to side, as though having some idea that there was another door to go out of,
				and then began to wander up and down the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston<span
					data-line="8538"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="8538"></span>s presence. His troubled eyes were gazing at the
				wall about a metre above the level of Winston<span data-line="8539"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="8539"></span>s head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes were
				sticking out of the holes in his socks. He was also several days away from a shave.
				A scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones, giving him an air of ruffianism
				that went oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movements.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8546">
				<span data-line="8546"></span>Winston roused hirnself a little from his lethargy. He
				must speak to Ampleforth, and risk the yell from the telescreen. It was even
				conceivable that Ampleforth was the bearer of the razor blade.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8551">
				<span data-line="8551"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Ampleforth,</em

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8553">
				<span data-line="8553"></span>There was no yell from the telescreen. Ampleforth
				paused, mildly startled. His eyes focused themselves slowly on Winston.

					>I have been able to recall one instance — a possible instance. It was an

				to look at Winston. <span data-line="8576"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>It was impossible to change the line. The rhyme was &#8220;rod&#8221;. Do you

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8582">
				<span data-line="8582"></span>The expression on his face changed. The annoyance
				passed out of it and for a moment he looked almost pleased. A sort of intellectual
				warmth, the joy of the pedant who has found out some useless fact, shone through the
				dirt and scrubby hair.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="8587">

			<p class="p indent" data-line="8604">
				<span data-line="8604"></span>They talked desultorily for some minutes, then,
				without apparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. Winston sat
				quietly, his hands crossed. Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow
				bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one knee,
				then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to keep still. Time passed.
				Twenty minutes, an hour — it was difficult to judge. Once more there was a sound of
				boots outside. Winston<span data-line="8611"></span>&#39;<span

			<p class="p indent" data-line="8616">
				<span data-line="8616"></span>The door opened. The cold-faced young officer stepped

				<span data-line="8640"></span>Parsons gave Winston a glance in which there was
				neither interest nor surprise, but only misery. He began walking jerkily up and
				down, evidently unable to keep still. Each time he straightened his pudgy knees it
				was apparent that they were trembling. His eyes had a wide-open, staring look, as
				though he could not prevent himself from gazing at something in the middle distance.

				said Parsons, almost blubbering. The tone of his voice implied at once a complete
				admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous horror that such a word could be
				applied to himself. He paused opposite Winston and began eagerly appealing to him:
				<span data-line="8654"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>You don&#39;t think they&#39;ll shoot me, do you, old chap? They don&#39;t

					They&#39;ll know my record, won&#39;t they? You know what kind of chap I was.
					Not a bad chap in my way. Not brainy, of course, but keen. I tried to do my best

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8710">
				<span data-line="8710"></span>Winston uncovered his face. Parsons used the lavatory,
				loudly and abundantly. It then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell
				stank abominably for hours afterwards.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8714">
				<span data-line="8714"></span>Parsons was removed. More prisoners came and went,
				mysteriously. One, a woman, was consigned to
				<span data-line="8715"></span>&#8216;_Room 101&#8217;<span data-line="8715"></span>,
				and, Winston noticed, seemed to shrivel and turn a different colour when she heard
				the words. A time came when, if it had been morning when he was brought here, it
				would be afternoon; or if it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. There
				were six prisoners in the cell, men and women. All sat very still. Opposite Winston
				there sat a man with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of some large,
				harmless rodent. His fat, mottled cheeks were so pouched at the bottom that it was
				difficult not to believe that he had little stores of food tucked away there. His
				pale-grey eyes flitted timorously from face to face and turned quickly away again
				when he caught anyone<span data-line="8727"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="8727"
				></span
				>s eye.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8729">
				<span data-line="8729"></span>The door opened, and another prisoner was brought in
				whose appearance sent a momentary chill through Winston. He was a commonplace,
				mean-looking man who might have been an engineer or technician of some kind. But
				what was startling was the emaciation of his face. It was like a skull. Because of
				its thinness the mouth and eyes looked disproportionately large, and the eyes seemed
				filled with a murderous, unappeasable hatred of somebody or something.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8738">
				<span data-line="8738"></span>The man sat down on the bench at a little distance
				from Winston. Winston did not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face
				was as vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes.
				Suddenly he realized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation. The same
				thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell. There was a
				very faint stirring all the way round the bench. The eyes of the chinless man kept
				flitting towards the skull-faced man, then turning guiltily away, then being dragged
				back by an irresistible attraction. Presently he began to fidget on his seat. At
				last he stood up, waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his
				overalls, and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to the skull-
				faced man.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8753">
				<span data-line="8753"></span>There was a furious, deafening roar from the
				telescreen. The chinless man jumped in his tracks. The skull-faced man had quickly
				thrust his hands behind his back, as though demonstrating to all the world that he
				refused the gift.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8758">
				<span data-line="8758"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Bumstead!</em>&#8217;<span

			<p class="p indent" data-line="8761">
				<span data-line="8761"></span>The chinless man dropped the piece of bread on the

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8766">
				<span data-line="8766"></span>The chinless man obeyed. His large pouchy cheeks were
				quivering uncontrollably. The door clanged open. As the young officer entered and
				stepped aside, there emerged from behind him a short stumpy guard with enormous arms
				and shoulders. He took his stand opposite the chinless man, and then, at a signal
				from the officer, let free a frightful blow, with all the weight of his body behind
				it, full in the chinless man<span data-line="8772"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="8772"
				></span
				>s mouth. The force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor. His body
				was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat. For
				a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood oozing from his mouth and nose. A
				very faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemed unconscious, came out of him. Then
				he rolled over and raised himself unsteadily on hands and knees. Amid a stream of
				blood and saliva, the two halves of a dental plate fell out of his mouth.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8782">
				<span data-line="8782"></span>The prisoners sat very still, their hands crossed on
				their knees. The chinless man climbed back into his place. Down one side of his face
				the flesh was darkening. His mouth had swollen into a shapeless cherry-coloured mass
				with a black hole in the middle of it.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8788">
				<span data-line="8788"></span>From time to time a little blood dripped on to the
				breast of his overalls. His grey eyes still flitted from face to face, more guiltily
				than ever, as though he were trying to discover how much the others despised him for
				his humiliation.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8793">
				<span data-line="8793"></span>The door opened. With a small gesture the officer

			<p class="p indent" data-line="8826">
				<span data-line="8826"></span>The man looked frantically round at the other

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8839">
				<span data-line="8839"></span>The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the
				arms. But just at this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and
				grabbed one of the iron legs that supported the bench. He had set up a wordless
				howling, like an animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose, but he
				clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at
				him. The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed on their knees, looking straight
				in front of them. The howling stopped; the man had no breath left for anything
				except hanging on. Then there was a different kind of cry. A kick from a guard<span
					data-line="8849"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="8849"></span>s boot had broken the fingers of one of his
				hands. They dragged him to his feet.

				<span data-line="8852"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">Room 101,</em>&#8217;<span

				said the officer.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8854">
				<span data-line="8854"></span>The man was led out, walking unsteadily, with head
				sunken, nursing his crushed hand, all the fight had gone out of him.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8857">
				<span data-line="8857"></span>A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the
				skull-faced man was taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon.
				Winston was alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow
				bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the telescreen.
				The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it. At the beginning
				it needed a hard effort not to look at it, but presently hunger gave way to thirst.
				His mouth was sticky and evil-tasting. The humming sound and the unvarying white
				light induced a sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get up
				because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit down again
				almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet.
				Whenever his physical sensations were a little under control the terror returned.
				Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of O<span data-line="8871"></span
				>&#8216;Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor blade might
				arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought of Julia.
				Somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he. She might be
				screaming with pain at this moment. He thought: &#8217;<span data-line="8876"></span
				><em class="em-low1"
					>If I could save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would.</em
				><span data-line="8877"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8877"></span> But that was
				merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought to take it. He
				did not feel it. In this place you could not feel anything, except pain and
				foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when you were actually suffering
				it, to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase? But that question was
				not answerable yet.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8885">
				<span data-line="8885"></span>The boots were approaching again. The door opened.
				O<span data-line="8885"></span>&#39;<span data-line="8885"></span>Brien came in.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8888">
				<span data-line="8888"></span>Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight
				had driven all caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the
				presence of the telescreen.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8892">
				<span data-line="8892"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>They&#39;ve got you too!</em

				<span data-line="8894"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"

				>&#8217;<span data-line="8894"></span> said O<span data-line="8894"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="8894"></span>Brien with a mild, almost regretful irony. He
				stepped aside. from behind him there emerged a broad-chested guard with a long black
				truncheon in his hand.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8899">
				<span data-line="8899"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">You know him, Winston,</em

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8902">
				<span data-line="8902"></span>Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was
				no time to think of that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard<span
					data-line="8904"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="8904"></span>s hand. It might fall anywhere; on the crown, on
				the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow-
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8907">
				<span data-line="8907"></span>The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost
				paralysed, clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand. Everything had exploded
				into yellow light. Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain!
				The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. The guard was
				laughing at his contortions. One question at any rate was answered. Never, for any
				reason on earth, could you wish for an increase of pain. Of pain you could wish only
				one thing: that it should stop. Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In
				the face of pain there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he
				writhed on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="8930">
				<span data-line="8930"></span>Even after his eyes were open he took in his

				had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his memories were not continuous. There
				had been times when consciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has in
				sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval. But whether the
				intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds, there was no way of knowing.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8942">
				<span data-line="8942"></span>With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had
				started. Later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a
				preliminary, a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected.
				There was a long range of crimes — espionage, sabotage, and the like — to which
				everyone had to confess as a matter of course. The confession was a formality,
				though the torture was real. How many times he had been beaten, how long the
				beatings had continued, he could not remember. Always there were five or six men in
				black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it was fists, sometimes it was
				truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. There were times
				when he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal, writhing his body this
				way and that in an endless, hopeless effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting
				more and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in
				his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. There were times
				when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not
				that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force hirnself into
				losing consciousness. There were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began
				shouting for mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight of a fist
				drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and
				imaginary crimes. There were other times when he started out with the resolve of
				confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of
				pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he said to
				himself: <span data-line="8969"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>I will confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable.
					Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I will tell them what they want.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="8972"></span> Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly
				stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell, left to
				recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again. There were also
				longer periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly, because they were spent
				chiefly in sleep or stupor. He remembered a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf
				sticking out from the wall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread
				and sometimes coffee. He remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and
				crop his hair, and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse,
				tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over him in
				search for broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="8987">
				<span data-line="8987"></span>The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a
				threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were
				unsatisfactory. His questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but Party
				intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spectacles, who
				worked on him in relays over periods which lasted — he thought, he could not be sure
				— ten or twelve hours at a stretch. These other questioners saw to it that he was in
				constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that they relied on. They slapped
				his face, wrung his ears. pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him
				leave to urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water;
				but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and
				reasoning. Their real weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on, hour
				after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twisting everything that he said,
				convicting him at every step of lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping
				as much from shame as from nervous fatigue Sometimes he would weep half a dozen
				times in a single session. Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and
				threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but
				sometimes they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in
				the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had
				not enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done.
				When his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning, even this appeal could
				reduce him to snivelling tears. In the end the nagging voices broke him down more
				completely than the boots and fists of the guards. He became simply a mouth that
				uttered, a hand that signed, whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to
				find out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the
				bullying started anew. He confessed to the assassination of eminent Party members,
				the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public funds, sale of
				military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed that he had been a spy in the
				pay of the Eastasian government as far back as 1968. He confessed that he was a
				religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sexual pervert. He confessed
				that he had murdered his wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have
				known, that his wife was still alive. He confessed that for years he had been in
				personal touch with Goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization
				which had included almost every human being he had ever known. It was easier to
				confess everything and implicate everybody. Besides, in a sense it was all true. It
				was true that he had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Party there
				was no distinction between the thought and the deed.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="9036">
				<span data-line="9036"></span>There were also memories of another kind. They stood
				out in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="9040">
				<span data-line="9040"></span>He was in a cell which might have been either dark or
				light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes. Near at hand some kind of
				instrument was ticking slowly and regularly. The eyes grew larger and more luminous.
				Suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed up.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="9047">
				<span data-line="9047"></span>He was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials,
				under dazzling lights. A man in a white coat was reading the dials. There was a
				tramp of heavy boots outside. The door clanged open. The waxed-faced officer marched
				in, followed by two guards.

			<p class="p indent" data-line="9055">
				<span data-line="9055"></span>The man in the white coat did not turn round. He did

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="9058">
				<span data-line="9058"></span>He was rolling down a mighty corridor, a kilometre
				wide, full of glorious, golden light, roaring with laughter and shouting out
				confessions at the top of his voice. He was confessing everything, even the things
				he had succeeded in holding back under the torture. He was relating the entire
				history of his life to an audience who knew it already. With him were the guards,
				the other questioners, the men in white coats, O<span data-line="9065"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="9065"></span>Brien, Julia, Mr Charrington, all rolling down
				the corridor together and shouting with laughter. Some dreadful thing which had lain
				embedded in the future had somehow been skipped over and had not happened.
				Everything was all right, there was no more pain, the last detail of his life was
				laid bare, understood, forgiven.

				>&#8216;Brien&#39;s voice. All through his interrogation, although he had never seen
				him, he had had the feeling that O&#39;Brien was at his elbow, just out of sight. It
				was O&#39;Brien who was directing everything. It was he who set the guards on to
				Winston and who prevented them from killing him. It was he who decided when Winston
				should scream with pain, when he should have a respite, when he should be fed, when
				he should sleep, when the drugs should be pumped into his arm. It was he who asked
				the questions and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector,
				he was the inquisitor, he was the friend. And once — Winston could not remember
				whether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment of
				wakefulness — a voice murmured in his ear: &#8217;<span data-line="9085"></span
				><em class="em-low1"
					>Don&#39;t worry, Winston; you are in my keeping. For seven years I have watched
					over you. Now the turning-point has come. I shall save you, I shall make you

				the same voice that had said to him, &#8217;<span data-line="9090"></span
				><em class="em-low1">We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,</em
				><span data-line="9090"></span>&#39;<span data-line="9090"></span>
				in that other dream, seven years ago.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="9093">
				<span data-line="9093"></span>He did not remember any ending to his interrogation.
				There was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had
				gradually materialized round him. He was almost flat on his back, and unable to
				move. His body was held down at every essential point. Even the back of his head was
				gripped in some manner. O<span data-line="9098"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="9098"

				>Brien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly. His face, seen from below,
				looked coarse and worn, with pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to
				chin. He was older than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or
				fifty. Under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round
				the face.

				could not see what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was
				being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening, or
				whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being wrenched out of
				shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Although the pain had brought the
				sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was the fear that his backbone was about
				to snap. He set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent
				as long as possible.

					that reality is something objective, external, existing in its own right. You
					also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude
					yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else
					sees the same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not
					external. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the
					individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in
					the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party
					holds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by
					looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that you have got to

					>The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no
					martyrdoms. You have read of the religious persecutions of the past. In the
					Middle Ages there was the Inquisitlon. It was a failure. It set out to eradicate
					heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it burned at the stake,
					thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because the Inquisition killed its
					enemies in the open, and killed them while they were still unrepentant: in fact,
					it killed them because they were unrepentant. Men were dying because they would
					not abandon their true beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim
					and all the shame to the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth
					century, there were the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the
					German Nazis and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more
					cruelly than the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learned
					from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not make
					martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they deliberately
					set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down by torture and
					solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing whatever was
					put into their mouths, covering themselves with abuse, accusing and sheltering

					the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not
					make mistakes of that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true.
					We make them true. And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us.
					You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston. Posterity
					will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from the stream of history.
					We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere. Nothing will
					remain of you, not a name in a register, not a memory in a living brain. You
					will be annihilated in the past as well as in the future. You will never have
					existed.</em

					>You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are a stain that must be wiped out.
					Did I not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the
					past? We are not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject
					submission. When finally you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will.
					We do not destroy the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we
					never destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him. We
					burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in
					appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one of ourselves before
					we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist
					anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless it may be. Even in the
					instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. In the old days the heretic
					walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming his heresy, exulting in it.
					Even the victim of the Russian purges could carry rebellion locked up in his
					skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet. But we make the
					brain perfect before we blow it out. The command of the old despotisms was
					&#8220;Thou shalt not&#8221;. The command of the totalitarians was &#8220;Thou
					shalt&#8221;. Our command is &#8220;Thou art&#8221;. No one whom we bring to
					this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed clean. Even those
					three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed — Jones, Aaronson,
					and Rutherford — in the end we broke them down. I took part in their
					interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down, whimpering, grovelling,
					weeping — and in the end it was not with pain or fear, only with penitence. By
					the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men. There was
					nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done, and love of Big
					Brother. It was touching to see how they loved him. They begged to be shot
					quickly, so that they could die while their minds were still clean.</em

				<span data-line="9799"></span>As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of

				knees a little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the

					presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we
					know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves,
					were- cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came
					very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize
					their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had
					seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner
					there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like
					that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing
					it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in
					order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish
					the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of

					It is time for you to gather some idea of what power means. The first thing you
					must realize is that power is collective. The individual only has power in so
					far as he ceases to be an individual. You know the Party slogan: &#8220;Freedom
					is Slavery&#8221;. Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is
					freedom. Alone — free — the human being is always defeated. It must be so,
					because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all
					failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape from
					his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he is the Party, then
					he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to realize is that
					power is power over human beings. Over the body but, above all, over the mind.
					Power over matter — external reality, as you would call it — is not important.
					Already our control over matter is absolute.</em

					>Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering,
					how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in
					inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and
					putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to
					see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the
					stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and
					treachery is torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world
					which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself. Progress in
					our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that
					they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world
					there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.
					Everything else we shall destroy everything. Already we are breaking down the
					habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut
					the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and
					woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the
					future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their
					mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be
					eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration
					card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now.
					There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no
					love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the
					laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no
					science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There
					will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity,
					no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed.
					But always — do not forget this, Winston — always there will be the intoxication
					of power, constantly increasing and constantly growing subtler. Always, at every
					moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an
					enemy who is helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot
					stamping on a human face — for ever.</em

					upon. The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so that he can be
					defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you have undergone since you
					have been in our hands — all that will continue, and worse. The espionage, the
					betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the executions, the disappearances will
					never cease. It will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph. The
					more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant: the weaker the
					opposition, the tighter the despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for
					ever. Every day, at every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed,
					spat upon and yet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out
					with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation
					after generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here
					at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible — and in the end
					utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own accord.
					That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of victory after
					victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing,
					pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning, I can see, to realize what
					that world will be like. But in the end you will do more than understand it. You

				<span data-line="10211"></span>He had stopped because he was frightened. A bowed,

				>s face seemed to be protruded, because of its bent carriage. A forlorn,
				jailbird<span data-line="10216"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10216"></span>s face
				with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and
				battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful. The
				cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was his own face,
				but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside. The
				emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt. He had gone
				partially bald. For the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well,
				but it was only the scalp that was grey. Except for his hands and a circle of his
				face, his body was grey all over with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under
				the dirt there were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer
				was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening
				thing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that
				of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs.
				He saw now what O<span data-line="10232"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10232"></span
				>Brien had meant about seeing the side view. The curvature of the spine was
				astonishing. The thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the
				chest, the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull.
				At a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from
				some malignant disease.

				pencil tied to the corner. At first he made no use of it. Even when he was awake he
				was completely torpid. Often he would lie from one meal to the next almost without
				stirring, sometimes asleep, sometimes waking into vague reveries in which it was too
				much trouble to open his eyes. He had long grown used to sleeping with a strong
				light on his face. It seemed to make no difference, except that one<span
					data-line="10373"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="10373"></span>s dreams were more coherent. He dreamed a great
				deal all through this time, and they were always happy dreams. He was in the Golden
				Country, or he was sitting among enormous glorious, sunlit ruins, with his mother,
				with Julia, with O<span data-line="10377"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10377"></span
				>Brien — not doing anything, merely sitting in the sun, talking of peaceful things.
				Such thoughts as he had when he was awake were mostly about his dreams. He seemed to
				have lost the power of intellectual effort, now that the stimulus of pain had been
				removed. He was not bored, he had no desire for conversation or distraction. Merely
				to be alone, not to be beaten or questioned, to have enough to eat, and to be clean
				all over, was completely satisfying.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10386">
				<span data-line="10386"></span>By degrees he came to spend less time in sleep, but
				he still felt no impulse to get off the bed. All he cared for was to lie quiet and
				feel the strength gathering in his body. He would finger himself here and there,
				trying to make sure that it was not an illusion that his muscles were growing
				rounder and his skin tauter. Finally it was established beyond a doubt that he was
				growing fatter; his thighs were now definitely thicker than his knees. After that,
				reluctantly at first, he began exercising himself regularly. In a little while he
				could walk three kilometres, measured by pacing the cell, and his bowed shoulders
				were growing straighter. He attempted more elaborate exercises, and was astonished
				and humiliated to find what things he could not do. He could not move out of a walk,
				he could not hold his stool out at arm<span data-line="10399"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="10399"
				></span
				>s length, he could not stand on one leg without falling over. He squatted down on
				his heels, and found that with agonizing pains in thigh and calf he could just lift
				himself to a standing position. He lay flat on his belly and tried to lift his
				weight by his hands. It was hopeless, he could not raise himself a centimetre. But
				after a few more days — a few more mealtimes — even that feat was accomplished. A
				time came when he could do it six times running. He began to grow actually proud of
				his body, and to cherish an intermittent belief that his face also was growing back
				to normal. Only when he chanced to put his hand on his bald scalp did he remember
				the seamed, ruined face that had looked back at him out of the mirror.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10413">
				<span data-line="10413"></span>His mind grew more active. He sat down on the plank
				bed, his back against the wall and the slate on his knees, and set to work
				deliberately at the task of re-educating himself.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10417">
				<span data-line="10417"></span>He had capitulated, that was agreed. In reality, as
				he saw now, he had been ready to capitulate long before he had taken the decision.
				From the moment when he was inside the Ministry of Love — and yes, even during those
				minutes when he and Julia had stood helpless while the iron voice from the
				telescreen told them what to do — he had grasped the frivolity, the shallowness of
				his attempt to set himself up against the power of the Party. He knew now that for
				seven years the Thought police had watched him like a beetle under a magnifying
				glass. There was no physical act, no word spoken aloud, that they had not noticed,
				no train of thought that they had not been able to infer. Even the speck of whitish
				dust on the cover of his diary they had carefully replaced. They had played
				sound-tracks to him, shown him photographs. Some of them were photographs of Julia
				and himself. Yes, even … He could not fight against the Party any longer. Besides,
				the Party was in the right. It must be so; how could the immortal, collective brain
				be mistaken? By what external standard could you check its judgements? Sanity was
				statistical. It was merely a question of learning to think as they thought. Only!
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10438">
				<span data-line="10438"></span>The pencil felt thick and awkward in his fingers. He
				began to write down the thoughts that came into his head. He wrote first in large
				clumsy capitals:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10442">
				<span data-line="10442"></span>FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10444">
				<span data-line="10444"></span>Then almost without a pause he wrote beneath it:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10446">
				<span data-line="10446"></span>TWO AND TWO MAKE FIVE
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10448">
				<span data-line="10448"></span>But then there came a sort of check. His mind, as
				though shying away from something, seemed unable to concentrate. He knew that he
				knew what came next, but for the moment he could not recall it. When he did recall
				it, it was only by consciously reasoning out what it must be: it did not come of its
				own accord. He wrote:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10455"><span data-line="10455"></span>GOD IS POWER</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10457">
				<span data-line="10457"></span>He accepted everything. The past was alterable. The
				past never had been altered. Oceania was at war with Eastasia. Oceania had always
				been at war with Eastasia. Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford were guilty of the crimes
				they were charged with. He had never seen the photograph that disproved their guilt.
				It had never existed, he had invented it. He remembered remembering contrary things,
				but those were false memories, products of self-deception. How easy it all was! Only
				surrender, and everything else followed. It was like swimming against a current that
				swept you backwards however hard you struggled, and then suddenly deciding to turn
				round and go with the current instead of opposing it. Nothing had changed except
				your own attitude: the predestined thing happened in any case. He hardly knew why he
				had ever rebelled. Everything was easy, except!
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10473">
				<span data-line="10473"></span>Anything could be true. The so-called laws of Nature
				were nonsense. The law of gravity was nonsense.

				><em class="em-low1">I could float off this floor like a soap bubble.</em
				><span data-line="10476"></span>&#39;<span data-line="10476"></span> Winston worked

					>If he thinks he floats off the floor, and if I simultaneously think I see him
					do it, then the thing happens.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="10478"></span> Suddenly, like a lump of submerged wreckage
				breaking the surface of water, the thought burst into his mind:
				<span data-line="10480"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>It doesn&#39;t really happen. We imagine it. It is hallucination.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="10481"></span> He pushed the thought under instantly. The
				fallacy was obvious. It presupposed that somewhere or other, outside oneself, there
				was a <span data-line="10483"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">real</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="10483"></span> world where
				<span data-line="10483"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">real</em>&#8217;<span
					data-line="10483"
				></span>
				things happened. But how could there be such a world? What knowledge have we of
				anything, save through our own minds? All happenings are in the mind. Whatever
				happens in all minds, truly happens.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10489">
				<span data-line="10489"></span>He had no difficulty in disposing of the fallacy, and
				he was in no danger of succumbing to it. He realized, nevertheless, that it ought
				never to have occurred to him. The mind should develop a blind spot whenever a
				dangerous thought presented itself. The process should be automatic, instinctive.
				Crimestop, they called it in Newspeak.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10496">
				<span data-line="10496"></span>He set to work to exercise himself in crimestop. He
				presented himself with propositions — <span data-line="10497"></span>&#8216;_the
				Party says the earth is flat&#8217;<span data-line="10498"></span>,
				<span data-line="10498"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>the party says that ice is heavier than water</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="10498"></span> — and trained himself in not seeing or not
				understanding the arguments that contradicted them. It was not easy. It needed great
				powers of reasoning and improvisation. The arithmetical problems raised, for
				instance, by such a statement as <span data-line="10502"></span>&#8216;<em
					class="em-low1"
					>two and two make five</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="10503"></span> were beyond his intellectual grasp. It
				needed also a sort of athleticism of mind, an ability at one moment to make the most
				delicate use of logic and at the next to be unconscious of the crudest logical
				errors. Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10509">
				<span data-line="10509"></span>All the while, with one part of his mind, he wondered
				how soon they would shoot him. <span data-line="10510"></span>&#8216;<em
					class="em-low1"
					>Everything depends on yourself,</em

				>Brien had said; but he knew that there was no conscious act by which he could bring
				it nearer. It might be ten minutes hence, or ten years. They might keep him for
				years in solitary confinement, they might send him to a labour-camp, they might
				release him for a while, as they sometimes did. It was perfectly possible that
				before he was shot the whole drama of his arrest and interrogation would be enacted
				all over again. The one certain thing was that death never came at an expected
				moment. The tradition — the unspoken tradition: somehow you knew it, though you
				never heard it said-was that they shot you from behind; always in the back of the
				head, without warning, as you walked down a corridor from cell to cell.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10524">
				<span data-line="10524"></span>One day — but

					data-line="10524"
				></span>
				was not the right expression; just as probably it was in the middle of the night:
				once — he fell into a strange, blissful reverie. He was walking down the corridor,
				waiting for the bullet. He knew that it was coming in another moment. Everything was
				settled, smoothed out, reconciled. There were no more doubts, no more arguments, no
				more pain, no more fear. His body was healthy and strong. He walked easily, with a
				joy of movement and with a feeling of walking in sunlight. He was not any longer in
				the narrow white corridors in the Ministry of Love, he was in the enormous sunlit
				passage, a kilometre wide, down which he had seemed to walk in the delirium induced
				by drugs. He was in the Golden Country, following the foot-track across the old
				rabbit-cropped pasture. He could feel the short springy turf under his feet and the
				gentle sunshine on his face. At the edge of the field were the elm trees, faintly
				stirring, and somewhere beyond that was the stream where the dace lay in the green
				pools under the willows.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10543">
				<span data-line="10543"></span>Suddenly he started up with a shock of horror. The
				sweat broke out on his backbone. He had heard himself cry aloud:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10546">
				<span data-line="10546"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Julia! Julia! Julia, my love! Julia!</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="10546"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10548">
				<span data-line="10548"></span>For a moment he had had an overwhelming hallucination
				of her presence. She had seemed to be not merely with him, but inside him. It was as
				though she had got into the texture of his skin. In that moment he had loved her far
				more than he had ever done when they were together and free. Also he knew that
				somewhere or other she was still alive and needed his help.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10555">
				<span data-line="10555"></span>He lay back on the bed and tried to compose himself.
				What had he done? How many years had he added to his servitude by that moment of
				weakness?
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10559">
				<span data-line="10559"></span>In another moment he would hear the tramp of boots
				outside. They could not let such an outburst go unpunished. They would know now, if
				they had not known before, that he was breaking the agreement he had made with them.
				He obeyed the Party, but he still hated the Party. In the old days he had hidden a
				heretical mind beneath an appearance of conformity. Now he had retreated a step
				further: in the mind he had surrendered, but he had hoped to keep the inner heart
				inviolate. He knew that he was in the wrong, but he preferred to be in the wrong.
				They would understand that- O<span data-line="10568"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="10568"
				></span
				>Brien would understand it. It was all confessed in that single foolish cry.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10571">
				<span data-line="10571"></span>He would have to start all over again. It might take
				years. He ran a hand over his face, trying to familiarize himself with the new
				shape. There were deep furrows in the cheeks, the cheekbones felt sharp, the nose
				flattened. Besides, since last seeing himself in the glass he had been given a
				complete new set of teeth. It was not easy to preserve inscrutability when you did
				not know what your face looked like. In any case, mere control of the features was
				not enough. For the first time he perceived that if you want to keep a secret you
				must also hide it from yourself. You must know all the while that it is there, but
				until it is needed you must never let it emerge into your consciousness in any shape
				that could be given a name. From now onwards he must not only think right; he must
				feel right, dream right. And all the while he must keep his hatred locked up inside
				him like a ball of matter which was part of himself and yet unconnected with the
				rest of him, a kind of cyst.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10589">
				<span data-line="10589"></span>One day they would decide to shoot him. You could not
				tell when it would happen, but a few seconds beforehand it should be possible to
				guess. It was always from behind, walking down a corridor. Ten seconds would be
				enough. In that time the world inside him could turn over. And then suddenly,
				without a word uttered, without a check in his step, without the changing of a line
				in his face — suddenly the camouflage would be down and bang! would go the batteries
				of his hatred. Hatred would fill him like an enormous roaring flame. And almost in
				the same instant bang! would go the bullet, too late, or too early. They would have
				blown his brain to pieces before they could reclaim it. The heretical thought would
				be unpunished, unrepented, out of their reach for ever. They would have blown a hole
				in their own perfection. To die hating them, that was freedom.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10604">
				<span data-line="10604"></span>He shut his eyes. It was more difficult than
				accepting an intellectual discipline. It was a question of degrading himself,
				mutilating himself. He had got to plunge into the filthiest of filth. What was the
				most horrible, sickening thing of all? He thought of Big Brother. The enormous face
				(because of constantly seeing it on posters he always thought of it as being a metre
				wide), with its heavy black moustache and the eyes that followed you to and fro,
				seemed to float into his mind of its own accord. What were his true feelings towards
				Big Brother?

			<p class="p indent" data-line="10615">
				<span data-line="10615"></span>There was a heavy tramp of boots in the passage. The

				<span data-line="10648"></span>At each stage of his imprisonment he had known, or

				<span data-line="10656"></span>It was bigger than most of the cells he had been in.

				in a chair, so tightly that he could move nothing, not even his head. A sort of pad

				like a fencing mask, with the concave side outwards. Although it was three or four
				metres away from him, he could see that the cage was divided lengthways into two
				compartments, and that there was some kind of creature in each. They were rats.

				him out of immense distances. Yet the cage with the rats was not two metres away
				from him. They were enormous rats. They were at the age when a rat<span

			<p class="p indent" data-line="10756">
				<span data-line="10756"></span>There was an outburst of squeals from the cage. It

			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10779">
				<span data-line="10779"></span>The cage was nearer; it was closing in. Winston heard
				a succession of shrill cries which appeared to be occurring in the air above his
				head. But he fought furiously against his panic. To think, to think, even with a
				split second left — to think was the only hope. Suddenly the foul musty odour of the
				brutes struck his nostrils. There was a violent convulsion of nausea inside him, and
				he almost lost consciousness. Everything had gone black. For an instant he was
				insane, a screaming animal. Yet he came out of the blackness clutching an idea.
				There was one and only one way to save himself. He must interpose another human
				being, the body of another human being, between himself and the rats.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10792">
				<span data-line="10792"></span>The circle of the mask was large enough now to shut
				out the vision of anything else. The wire door was a couple of hand-spans from his
				face. The rats knew what was coming now. One of them was leaping up and down, the
				other, an old scaly grandfather of the sewers, stood up, with his pink hands against
				the bars, and fiercely sniffed the air. Winston could see the whiskers and the
				yellow teeth. Again the black panic took hold of him. He was blind, helpless,
				mindless.

				could thrust between himself and the rats. And he was shouting frantically, over and

			</h2>
			<p class="p noindent" data-line="10829">
				<span data-line="10829"></span>The Chestnut Tree was almost empty. A ray of sunlight
				slanting through a window fell on dusty table-tops. It was the lonely hour of
				fifteen. A tinny music trickled from the telescreens.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10834">
				<span data-line="10834"></span>Winston sat in his usual corner, gazing into an empty
				glass. Now and again he glanced up at a vast face which eyed him from the opposite
				wall. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said. Unbidden, a waiter came and
				filled his glass up with Victory Gin, shaking into it a few drops from another
				bottle with a quill through the cork. It was saccharine flavoured with cloves, the
				speciality of the café.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10842">
				<span data-line="10842"></span>Winston was listening to the telescreen. At present
				only music was coming out of it, but there was a possibility that at any moment
				there might be a special bulletin from the Ministry of Peace. The news from the
				African front was disquieting in the extreme. On and off he had been worrying about
				it all day. A Eurasian army (Oceania was at war with Eurasia: Oceania had always
				been at war with Eurasia) was moving southward at terrifying speed. The mid-day
				bulletin had not mentioned any definite area, but it was probable that already the
				mouth of the Congo was a battlefield. Brazzaville and Leopoldville were in danger.
				One did not have to look at the map to see what it meant. It was not merely a
				question of losing Central Africa: for the first time in the whole war, the
				territory of Oceania itself was menaced.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10857">
				<span data-line="10857"></span>A violent emotion, not fear exactly but a sort of
				undifferentiated excitement, flared up in him, then faded again. He stopped thinking
				about the war. In these days he could never fix his mind on any one subject for more
				than a few moments at a time. He picked up his glass and drained it at a gulp. As
				always, the gin made him shudder and even retch slightly. The stuff was horrible.
				The cloves and saccharine, themselves disgusting enough in their sickly way, could
				not disguise the flat oily smell; and what was worst of all was that the smell of
				gin, which dwelt with him night and day, was inextricably mixed up in his mind with
				the smell of those —
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10869">
				<span data-line="10869"></span>He never named them, even in his thoughts, and so far
				as it was possible he never visualized them. They were something that he was
				half-aware of, hovering close to his face, a smell that clung to his nostrils. As
				the gin rose in him he belched through purple lips. He had grown fatter since they
				released him, and had regained his old colour — indeed, more than regained it. His
				features had thickened, the skin on nose and cheekbones was coarsely red, even the
				bald scalp was too deep a pink. A waiter, again unbidden, brought the chessboard and
				the current issue of The Times, with the page turned down at the chess problem.
				Then, seeing that Winston<span data-line="10879"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="10879"
				></span
				>s glass was empty, he brought the gin bottle and filled it. There was no need to
				give orders. They knew his habits. The chessboard was always waiting for him, his
				corner table was always reserved; even when the place was full he had it to himself,
				since nobody cared to be seen sitting too close to him. He never even bothered to
				count his drinks. At irregular intervals they presented him with a dirty slip of
				paper which they said was the bill, but he had the impression that they always
				undercharged him. It would have made no difference if it had been the other way
				about. He had always plenty of money nowadays. He even had a job, a sinecure, more
				highly-paid than his old job had been.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10893">
				<span data-line="10893"></span>The music from the telescreen stopped and a voice
				took over. Winston raised his head to listen. No bulletins from the front, however.
				It was merely a brief announcement from the Ministry of Plenty. In the preceding
				quarter, it appeared, the Tenth Three-Year Plan<span data-line="10897"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="10897"></span>s quota for bootlaces had been overfulfilled by
				98 per cent.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10900">
				<span data-line="10900"></span>He examined the chess problem and set out the pieces.
				It was a tricky ending, involving a couple of knights.
				<span data-line="10901"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>White to play and mate in two moves.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="10902"></span> Winston looked up at the portrait of Big
				Brother. White always mates, he thought with a sort of cloudy mysticism. Always,
				without exception, it is so arranged. In no chess problem since the beginning of the
				world has black ever won. Did it not symbolize the eternal, unvarying triumph of
				Good over Evil? The huge face gazed back at him, full of calm power. White always
				mates.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10910">
				<span data-line="10910"></span>The voice from the telescreen paused and added in a
				different and much graver tone: <span data-line="10911"></span>&#8216;<em
					class="em-low1"
					>You are warned to stand by for an important announcement at fifteen-thirty.
					Fifteen-thirty! This is news of the highest importance. Take care not to miss
					it. Fifteen-thirty!</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="10914"></span> The tinking music struck up again.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10916">
				<span data-line="10916"></span>Winston<span data-line="10916"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="10916"
				></span
				>s heart stirred. That was the bulletin from the front; instinct told him that it
				was bad news that was coming. All day, with little spurts of excitement, the thought
				of a smashing defeat in Africa had been in and out of his mind. He seemed actually
				to see the Eurasian army swarming across the never-broken frontier and pouring down
				into the tip of Africa like a column of ants. Why had it not been possible to
				outflank them in some way? The outline of the West African coast stood out vividly
				in his mind. He picked up the white knight and moved it across the board. There was
				the proper spot. Even while he saw the black horde racing southward he saw another
				force, mysteriously assembled, suddenly planted in their rear, cutting their
				comunications by land and sea. He felt that by willing it he was bringing that other
				force into existence. But it was necessary to act quickly. If they could get control
				of the whole of Africa, if they had airfields and submarine bases at the Cape, it
				would cut Oceania in two. It might mean anything: defeat, breakdown, the redivision
				of the world, the destruction of the Party! He drew a deep breath. An extraordinary
				medley of feeling-but it was not a medley, exactly; rather it was successive layers
				of feeling, in which one could not say which layer was undermost struggled inside
				him.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10940">
				<span data-line="10940"></span>The spasm passed. He put the white knight back in its
				place, but for the moment he could not settle down to serious study of the chess
				problem. His thoughts wandered again. Almost unconsciously he traced with his finger
				in the dust on the table:
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10946">

			<p class="p indent" data-line="10954">
				<span data-line="10954"></span>He had seen her; he had even spoken to her. There was
				no danger in it. He knew as though instinctively that they now took almost no
				interest in his doings. He could have arranged to meet her a second time if either
				of them had wanted to. Actually it was by chance that they had met. It was in the
				Park, on a vile, biting day in March, when the earth was like iron and all the grass
				seemed dead and there was not a bud anywhere except a few crocuses which had pushed
				themselves up to be dismembered by the wind. He was hurrying along with frozen hands
				and watering eyes when he saw her not ten metres away from him. It struck him at
				once that she had changed in some ill-defined way. They almost passed one another
				without a sign, then he turned and followed her, not very eagerly. He knew that
				there was no danger, nobody would take any interest in him. She did not speak. She
				walked obliquely away across the grass as though trying to get rid of him, then
				seemed to resign herself to having him at her side. Presently they were in among a
				clump of ragged leafless shrubs, useless either for concealment or as protection
				from the wind. They halted. It was vilely cold. The wind whistled through the twigs
				and fretted the occasional, dirty-looking crocuses. He put his arm round her waist.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10977">
				<span data-line="10977"></span>There was no telescreen, but there must be hidden
				microphones: besides, they could be seen. It did not matter, nothing mattered. They
				could have lain down on the ground and done that if they had wanted to. His flesh
				froze with horror at the thought of it. She made no response whatever to the clasp
				of his arm ; she did not even try to disengage herself. He knew now what had changed
				in her. Her face was sallower, and there was a long scar, partly hidden by the hair,
				across her forehead and temple; but that was not the change. It was that her waist
				had grown thicker, and, in a surprising way, had stiffened. He remembered how once,
				after the explosion of a rocket bomb, he had helped to drag a corpse out of some
				ruins, and had been astonished not only by the incredible weight of the thing, but
				by its rigidity and awkwardness to handle, which made it seem more like stone than
				flesh. Her body felt like that. It occurred to him that the texture of her skin
				would be quite different from what it had once been.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="10995">
				<span data-line="10995"></span>He did not attempt to kiss her, nor did they speak.
				As they walked back across the grass, she looked directly at him for the first time.
				It was only a momentary glance, full of contempt and dislike. He wondered whether it
				was a dislike that came purely out of the past or whether it was inspired also by
				his bloated face and the water that the wind kept squeezing from his eyes. They sat
				down on two iron chairs, side by side but not too close together. He saw that she
				was about to speak. She moved her clumsy shoe a few centimetres and deliberately
				crushed a twig. Her feet seemed to have grown broader, he noticed.

				off, but walked at just such a speed as to prevent his keeping abreast of her. He
				had made up his mind that he would accompany her as far as the Tube station, but
				suddenly this process of trailing along in the cold seemed pointless and unbearable.
				He was overwhelmed by a desire not so much to get away from Julia as to get back to
				the Chestnut Tree Café, which had never seemed so attractive as at this moment. He
				had a nostalgic vision of his corner table, with the newspaper and the chessboard
				and the ever-flowing gin. Above all, it would be warm in there. The next moment, not
				altogether by accident, he allowed himself to become separated from her by a small
				knot of people. He made a halfhearted attempt to catch up, then slowed down, turned,
				and made off in the opposite direction. When he had gone fifty metres he looked
				back. The street was not crowded, but already he could not distinguish her. Any one
				of a dozen hurrying figures might have been hers. Perhaps her thickened, stiffened
				body was no longer recognizable from behind.

				<span data-line="11068"></span>Something changed in the music that trickled from the
				telescreen. A cracked and jeering note, a yellow note, came into it. And then —
				perhaps it was not happening, perhaps it was only a memory taking on the semblance
				of sound — a voice was singing:
			</p>
			<pre
				class="para-block pre-indented"
				data-line="11074"
				style="display: block"
			><code>         &#39;_Under the spreading chestnut tree

			<p class="p noindent para-continued" data-line="11077">
				<span data-line="11077"></span>The tears welled up in his eyes. A passing waiter
				noticed that his glass was empty and came back with the gin bottle.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11080">
				<span data-line="11080"></span>He took up his glass and sniffed at it. The stuff
				grew not less but more horrible with every mouthful he drank. But it had become the
				element he swam in. It was his life, his death, and his resurrection. It was gin
				that sank him into stupor every night, and gin that revived him every morning. When
				he woke, seldom before eleven hundred, with gummed-up eyelids and fiery mouth and a
				back that seemed to be broken, it would have been impossible even to rise from the
				horizontal if it had not been for the bottle and teacup placed beside the bed
				overnight. Through the midday hours he sat with glazed face, the bottle handy,
				listening to the telescreen. From fifteen to closing-time he was a fixture in the
				Chestnut Tree. No one cared what he did any longer, no whistle woke him, no
				telescreen admonished him. Occasionally, perhaps twice a week, he went to a dusty,
				forgotten-looking office in the Ministry of Truth and did a little work, or what was
				called work. He had been appointed to a sub-committee of a sub-committee which had
				sprouted from one of the innumerable committees dealing with minor difficulties that
				arose in the compilation of the Eleventh Edition of the Newspeak Dictionary. They
				were engaged in producing something called an Interim Report, but what it was that
				they were reporting on he had never definitely found out. It was something to do
				with the question of whether commas should be placed inside brackets, or outside.
				There were four others on the committee, all of them persons similar to himself.
				There were days when they assembled and then promptly dispersed again, frankly
				admitting to one another that there was not really anything to be done. But there
				were other days when they settled down to their work almost eagerly, making a
				tremendous show of entering up their minutes and drafting long memoranda which were
				never finished — when the argument as to what they were supposedly arguing about
				grew extraordinarily involved and abstruse, with subtle haggling over definitions,
				enormous digressions, quarrels threats, even, to appeal to higher authority. And
				then suddenly the life would go out of them and they would sit round the table
				looking at one another with extinct eyes, like ghosts fading at cock-crow.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11118">
				<span data-line="11118"></span>The telescreen was silent for a moment. Winston
				raised his head again. The bulletin! But no, they were merely changing the music. He
				had the map of Africa behind his eyelids. The movement of the armies was a diagram:
				a black arrow tearing vertically southward, and a white arrow horizontally eastward,
				across the tail of the first. As though for reassurance he looked up at the
				imperturbable face in the portrait. Was it conceivable that the second arrow did not
				even exist?
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11127">
				<span data-line="11127"></span>His interest flagged again. He drank another mouthful
				of gin, picked up the white knight and made a tentative move. Check. But it was
				evidently not the right move, because
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11131">
				<span data-line="11131"></span>Uncalled, a memory floated into his mind. He saw a
				candle-lit room with a vast white-counterpaned bed, and himself, a boy of nine or
				ten, sitting on the floor, shaking a dice-box, and laughing excitedly. His mother
				was sitting opposite him and also laughing.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11137">
				<span data-line="11137"></span>It must have been about a month before she
				disappeared. It was a moment of reconciliation, when the nagging hunger in his belly
				was forgotten and his earlier affection for her had temporarily revived. He
				remembered the day well, a pelting, drenching day when the water streamed down the
				window-pane and the light indoors was too dull to read by. The boredom of the two
				children in the dark, cramped bedroom became unbearable. Winston whined and
				grizzled, made futile demands for food, fretted about the room pulling everything
				out of place and kicking the wainscoting until the neighbours banged on the wall,
				while the younger child wailed intermittently. In the end his mother said,
				<span data-line="11148"></span>&#8216;_Now be good, and I&#39;Il buy you a toy. A
				lovely toy — you&#39;ll love it&#8217;<span data-line="11149"></span>; and then she
				had gone out in the rain, to a little general shop which was still sporadically open
				nearby, and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of Snakes and
				Ladders. He could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard. It was a miserable
				outfit. The board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that they
				would hardly lie on their sides. Winston looked at the thing sulkily and without
				interest. But then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor
				to play. Soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddly-winks
				climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again,
				almost to the starting- point. They played eight games, winning four each. His tiny
				sister, too young to understand what the game was about, had sat propped up against
				a bolster, laughing because the others were laughing. For a whole afternoon they had
				all been happy together, as in his earlier childhood.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11167">
				<span data-line="11167"></span>He pushed the picture out of his mind. It was a false
				memory. He was troubled by false memories occasionally. They did not matter so long
				as one knew them for what they were. Some things had happened, others had not
				happened. He turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again.
				Almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter. He had started
				as though a pin had run into him.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11175">
				<span data-line="11175"></span>A shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air. It was the
				bulletin! Victory! It always meant victory when a trumpet-call preceded the news. A
				sort of electric drill ran through the café. Even the waiters had started and
				pricked up their ears.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11180">
				<span data-line="11180"></span>The trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of
				noise. Already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but even as it
				started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside. The news had run
				round the streets like magic. He could hear just enough of what was issuing from the
				telescreen to realize that it had all happened, as he had foreseen; a vast seaborne
				armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy<span

				of the black. Fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din:
				<span data-line="11189"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Vast strategic manoeuvre — perfect co-ordination — utter rout — half a million
					prisoners — complete demoralization — control of the whole of Africa — bring the

			<p class="p indent" data-line="11196">
				<span data-line="11196"></span>Under the table Winston<span data-line="11196"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="11196"></span>s feet made convulsive movements. He had not
				stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running, he was with
				the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. He looked up again at the portrait of Big
				Brother. The colossus that bestrode the world! The rock against which the hordes of
				Asia dashed themselves in vain! He thought how ten minutes ago-yes, only ten minutes
				— there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news
				from the front would be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eurasian army
				that had perished! Much had changed in him since that first day in the Ministry of
				Love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened, until this
				moment.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11210">
				<span data-line="11210"></span>The voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth
				its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died
				down a little. The waiters were turning back to their work. One of them approached
				with the gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention as his
				glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any longer. He was back in the
				Ministry of Love, with everything forgiven, his soul white as snow. He was in the
				public dock, confessing everything, implicating everybody. He was walking down the
				white-tiled corridor, with the feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at
				his back. The longhoped-for bullet was entering his brain.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11223">
				<span data-line="11223"></span>He gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had
				taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache. O
				cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving
				breast! Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all
				right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory
				over himself. He loved Big Brother.

				><span data-line="11233"></span>
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11235">
				<span data-line="11235"></span>Newspeak was the official language of Oceania and had
				been devised to meet the ideological needs of Ingsoc, or English Socialism. In the
				year 1984 there was not as yet anyone who used Newspeak as his sole means of
				communication, either in speech or writing. The leading articles in The Times were
				written in it, but this was a tour de force which could only be carried out by a
				specialist. It was expected that Newspeak would have finally superseded Oldspeak (or
				Standard English, as we should call it) by about the year 2050. Meanwhile it gained
				ground steadily, all Party members tending to use Newspeak words and grammatical
				constructions more and more in their everyday speech. The version in use in 1984,
				and embodied in the Ninth and Tenth Editions of the Newspeak Dictionary, was a
				provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which
				were due to be suppressed later. It is with the final, perfected version, as
				embodied in the Eleventh Edition of the Dictionary, that we are concerned here.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11254">
				<span data-line="11254"></span>The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a
				medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of
				Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that when
				Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical
				thought — that is, a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc — should be
				literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. Its
				vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to
				every meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express, while excluding
				all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods.
				This was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating
				undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings,
				and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. To give a single example.
				The word free still existed in Newspeak, but it could only be used in such
				statements as <span data-line="11271"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>This dog is free from lice</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="11271"></span> or
				<span data-line="11272"></span>&#8216;_This field is free from weeds&#8217;<span
					data-line="11272"
				></span
				>. It could not be used in its old sense of <span data-line="11273"></span
				><em class="em-low1">&#39; politically free</em
				><span data-line="11273"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11273"></span> or
				<span data-line="11273"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">intellectually free</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="11273"></span> since political and intellectual freedom no
				longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless. Quite
				apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vocabulary
				was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be dispensed with was
				allowed to survive. Newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of
				thought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words
				down to a minimum.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11283">
				<span data-line="11283"></span>Newspeak was founded on the English language as we
				now know it, though many Newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created
				words, would be barely intelligible to an English-speaker of our own day. Newspeak
				words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the A vocabulary, the B
				vocabulary (also called compound words), and the C vocabulary. It will be simpler to
				discuss each class separately, but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can
				be dealt with in the section devoted to the A vocabulary, since the same rules held
				good for all three categories.
			</p>
			<h5
				id="sec-the-a-vocabulary"
				class="h4"
				data-line="11294"
				data-heading-depth="4"

			>
				<span data-line="11294"></span>The A vocabulary
			</h5>
			<p class="p noindent" data-line="11296">
				<span data-line="11296"></span>The A vocabulary consisted of the words needed for
				the business of everyday life — for such things as eating, drinking, working,
				putting on one<span data-line="11298"></span>&#39;<span data-line="11298"></span>s
				clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles, gardening, cooking, and the
				like. It was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess words like
				hit, run, dog, tree, sugar, house, field — but in comparison with the present-day
				English vocabulary their number was extremely small, while their meanings were far
				more rigidly defined. All ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of
				them. So far as it could be achieved, a Newspeak word of this class was simply a
				staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept. It would have been quite
				impossible to use the A vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or
				philosophical discussion. It was intended only to express simple, purposive
				thoughts, usually involving concrete objects or physical actions.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11314">
				<span data-line="11314"></span>The grammar of Newspeak had two outstanding
				peculiarities. The first of these was an almost complete interchangeability between
				different parts of speech. Any word in the language (in principle this applied even
				to very abstract words such as if or when) could be used either as verb, noun,
				adjective, or adverb. Between the verb and the noun form, when they were of the same
				root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself involving the destruction
				of many archaic forms. The word thought, for example, did not exist in Newspeak. Its
				place was taken by think, which did duty for both noun and verb. No etymological
				principle was followed here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen
				for retention, in other cases the verb. Even where a noun and verb of kindred
				meaning were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently
				suppressed. There was, for example, no such word as cut, its meaning being
				sufficiently covered by the noun-verb knife. Adjectives were formed by adding the
				suffix-ful to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding<span data-line="11332"></span>
				<span data-line="11332"></span> <span data-line="11332"></span>-wise. Thus for
				example, speedful meant <span data-line="11333"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>rapid</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="11333"></span> and speedwise meant
				<span data-line="11334"></span>&#8216;_quickly&#8217;<span data-line="11334"></span
				>. Certain of our present-day adjectives, such as good, strong, big, black, soft,
				were retained, but their total number was very small. There was little need for
				them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding-ful to a
				noun-verb. None of the now-existing adverbs was retained, except for a very few
				already ending in-wise: the<span data-line="11340"></span>
				<span data-line="11340"></span> <span data-line="11340"></span>-wise termination was
				invariable. The word well, for example, was replaced by goodwise.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11344">
				<span data-line="11344"></span>In addition, any word — this again applied in
				principle to every word in the language — could be negatived by adding the affix un-
				or could be strengthened by the affix plus-, or, for still greater emphasis,
				doubleplus-. Thus, for example, uncold meant
				<span data-line="11349"></span>&#8216;_warm&#8217;<span data-line="11349"></span>,
				while pluscold and doublepluscold meant, respectively,
				<span data-line="11350"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">very cold</em>&#8217;<span
					data-line="11350"
				></span>
				and <span data-line="11350"></span>&#8216;_superlatively cold&#8217;<span
					data-line="11350"
				></span
				>. It was also possible, as in present-day English, to modify the meaning of almost
				any word by prepositional affixes such as ante-, post-, up-, down-, etc. By such
				methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary.
				Given, for instance, the word good, there was no need for such a word as bad, since
				the required meaning was equally well — indeed, better — expressed by ungood. All
				that was necessary, in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites,
				was to decide which of them to suppress. Dark, for example, could be replaced by
				unlight, or light by undark, according to preference.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11364">
				<span data-line="11364"></span>The second distinguishing mark of Newspeak grammar
				was its regularity. Subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all
				inflexions followed the same rules. Thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past
				participle were the same and ended in-ed. The preterite of steal was stealed, the
				preterite of think was thinked, and so on throughout the language, all such forms as
				swam, gave, brought, spoke, taken, etc., being abolished. All plurals were made by
				adding-s or-es as the case might be. The plurals of man, ox, life, were mans, oxes,
				lifes. Comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding-er,-est (good, gooder,
				goodest), irregular forms and the more, most formation being suppressed.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11379">
				<span data-line="11379"></span>The only classes of words that were still allowed to
				inflect irregularly were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives,
				and the auxiliary verbs. All of these followed their ancient usage, except that whom
				had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the shall, should tenses had been dropped, all
				their uses being covered by will and would. There were also certain irregularities
				in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech. A word which
				was difficult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso
				facto a bad word: occasionally therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters
				were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained. But this need made
				itself felt chiefly in connexion with the B vocabulary. Why so great an importance
				was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay.
			</p>
			<h5
				id="sec-the-b-vocabulary"

				data-line="11396"

				<span data-line="11396"></span>The B vocabulary
			</h5>
			<p class="p noindent" data-line="11398">
				<span data-line="11398"></span>The B vocabulary consisted of words which had been
				deliberately constructed for political purposes: words, that is to say, which not
				only had in every case a political implication, but were intended to impose a
				desirable mental attitude upon the person using them. Without a full understanding
				of the principles of Ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly. In some
				cases they couId be translated into Oldspeak, or even into words taken from the A
				vocabulary, but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss
				of certain overtones. The B words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing
				whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more accurate and
				forcible than ordinary language.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11412">
				<span data-line="11412"></span>The B words were in all cases compound words.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11414">
				<span data-line="11414"></span>They consisted of two or more words, or portions of
				words, welded together in an easily pronounceable form. The resulting amalgam was
				always a noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules. To take a single
				example: the word goodthink, meaning, very roughly,
				<span data-line="11419"></span>&#8216;_orthodoxy&#8217;<span
					data-line="11419"
				></span
				>, or, if one chose to regard it as a verb,
				<span data-line="11420"></span>&#8216;_to think in an orthodox manner&#8217;<span
					data-line="11420"
				></span
				>. This inflected as follows: noun-verb, goodthink; past tense and past participle,
				goodthinked; present participle, good- thinking; adjective, goodthinkful; adverb,
				goodthinkwise; verbal noun, goodthinker.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11426">
				<span data-line="11426"></span>The B words were not constructed on any etymological
				plan. The words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could
				be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce
				while indicating their derivation. In the word crimethink (thoughtcrime), for
				instance, the think came second, whereas in thinkpol Thought Police) it came first,
				and in the latter word police had lost its second syllable. Because of the great
				difficuIty in securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner in the B
				vocabulary than in the A vocabulary. For example, the adjective forms of Minitrue,
				Minipax, and Miniluv were, respectively, Minitruthful, Minipeaceful, and Minilovely,
				simply because- trueful,-paxful, and-loveful were slightly awkward to pronounce. In
				principle, however, all B words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the same
				way.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11443">
				<span data-line="11443"></span>Some of the B words had highly subtilized meanings,
				barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole.
				Consider, for example, such a typical sentence from a Times leading article as
				Oldthinkers unbellyfeel Ingsoc. The shortest rendering that one could make of this
				in Oldspeak would be: <span data-line="11448"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>Those whose ideas were formed before the Revolution cannot have a full
					emotional understanding of the principles of English Socialism.</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="11450"></span> But this is not an adequate translation. To
				begin with, in order to
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11453">
				<span data-line="11453"></span>Compound words such as speakwrite, were of course to
				be found in the A vocabulary, but these were merely convenient abbreviations and had
				no special ideologcal colour.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11458">
				<span data-line="11458"></span>grasp the full meaning of the Newspeak sentence
				quoted above, one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by Ingsoc. And in
				addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in Ingsoc could appreciate the full
				force of the word bellyfeel, which implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance
				difficult to imagine today; or of the word oldthink, which was inextricably mixed up
				with the idea of wickedness and decadence. But the special function of certain
				Newspeak words, of which oldthink was one, was not so much to express meanings as to
				destroy them. These words, necessarily few in number, had had their meanings
				extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as
				they were sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped
				and forgotten. The greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the Newspeak
				Dictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make sure what
				they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words they cancelled by
				their existence.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11477">
				<span data-line="11477"></span>As we have already seen in the case of the word free,
				words which had once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake
				of convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them. Countless
				other words such as honour, justice, morality, internationalism, democracy, science,
				and religion had simply ceased to exist. A few blanket words covered them, and, in
				covering them, abolished them. All words grouping themselves round the concepts of
				liberty and equality, for instance, were contained in the single word crimethink,
				while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and
				rationalism were contained in the single word oldthink. Greater precision would have
				been dangerous. What was required in a Party member was an outlook similar to that
				of the ancient Hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all nations other
				than his own worshipped <span data-line="11492"></span>&#8216;_false
				gods&#8217;<span data-line="11492"></span>. He did not need to know that these gods
				were called Baal, Osiris, Moloch, Ashtaroth, and the like: probably the less he knew
				about them the better for his orthodoxy. He knew Jehovah and the commandments of
				Jehovah: he knew, therefore, that all gods with other names or other attributes were
				false gods. In somewhat the same way, the party member knew what constituted right
				conduct, and in exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure
				from it were possible. His sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by the
				two Newspeak words sexcrime (sexual immorality) and goodsex (chastity). Sexcrime
				covered all sexual misdeeds whatever. It covered fornication, adultery,
				homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal intercourse practised
				for its own sake. There was no need to enumerate them separately, since they were
				all equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishable by death. In the C
				vocabulary, which consisted of scientific and technical words, it might be necessary
				to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen
				had no need of them. He knew what was meant by goodsex — that is to say, normal
				intercourse between man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and
				without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was sexcrime. In
				Newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the
				perception that it was heretical: beyond that point the necessary words were
				nonexistent.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11520">
				<span data-line="11520"></span>No word in the B vocabulary was ideologically
				neutral. A great many were euphemisms. Such words, for instance, as joycamp
				(forced-labour camp) or Minipax Ministry of Peace, i. e. Ministry of War) meant
				almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean. Some words, on the other
				hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of Oceanic
				society. An example was prolefeed, meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious
				news which the Party handed out to the masses. Other words, again, were ambivalent,
				having the connotation <span data-line="11529"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1"
					>good</em
				>&#8217;<span data-line="11529"></span> when applied to the Party and
				<span data-line="11530"></span>&#8216;<em class="em-low1">bad</em>&#8217;<span
					data-line="11530"
				></span>
				when applied to its enemies. But in addition there were great numbers of words which
				at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological
				colour not from their meaning, but from their structure.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11536">
				<span data-line="11536"></span>So far as it could be contrived, everything that had
				or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the B vocabulary.
				The name of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or
				institution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape;
				that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that
				would preserve the original derivation. In the Ministry of Truth, for example, the
				Records Department, in which Winston Smith worked, was called Recdep, the Fiction
				Department was called Ficdep, the Teleprogrammes Department was called Teledep, and
				so on. This was not done solely with the object of saving time. Even in the early
				decades of the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the
				characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed that the
				tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries
				and totalitarian organizations. Examples were such words as Nazi, Gestapo, Comin-
				tern, Inprecorr, Agitprop. In the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were
				instinctively, but in Newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose. It was
				perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its
				meaning, by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it.
				The words Communist International, for instance, call up a composite picture of
				universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, Karl Marx, and the Paris
				Commune. The word Comintern, on the other hand, suggests merely a tightly-knit
				organization and a well-defined body of doctrine. It refers to something almost as
				easily recognized, and as limited in purpose, as a chair or a table. Comintern is a
				word that can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas Communist
				International is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily.
				In the same way, the associations called up by a word like Minitrue are fewer and
				more controllable than those called up by Ministry of Truth. This accounted not only
				for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the almost exaggerated
				care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11576">
				<span data-line="11576"></span>In Newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration
				other than exactitude of meaning. Regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it
				when it seemed necessary. And rightly so, since what was required, above all for
				political purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be
				uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker<span
					data-line="11582"
				></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="11582"></span>s mind. The words of the B vocabulary even
				gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike. Almost
				invariably these words — goodthink, Minipax, prolefeed, sexcrime, joycamp, Ingsoc,
				bellyfeel, thinkpol, and countless others — were words of two or three syllables,
				with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last. The use
				of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous. And
				this was exactly what was aimed at. The intention was to make speech, and especially
				speech on any subject not ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent
				of consciousness. For the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or
				sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a Party member called upon to
				make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct
				opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets. His training
				fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument, and the
				texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which was
				in accord with the spirit of Ingsoc, assisted the process still further.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11603">
				<span data-line="11603"></span>So did the fact of having very few words to choose
				from. Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of
				reducing it were constantly being devised. Newspeak, indeed, differed from most all
				other languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year.
				Each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice, the smaller the
				temptation to take thought. Ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue
				from the larynx without involving the higher brain centres at all. This aim was
				frankly admitted in the Newspeak word duckspeak, meaning
				<span data-line="11612"></span>_<span data-line="11612"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="11612"
				></span>
				to quack like a duck<span data-line="11613"></span>&#39;<span
					data-line="11613"
				></span
				>. Like various other words in the B vocabulary, duckspeak was ambivalent in
				meaning. Provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it
				implied nothing but praise, and when The Times referred to one of the orators of the
				Party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it was paying a warm and valued compliment.

				<span data-line="11621"></span>The C vocabulary
			</h5>
			<p class="p noindent" data-line="11623">
				<span data-line="11623"></span>The C vocabulary was supplementary to the others and
				consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms. These resembled the scientific
				terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots, but the usual care was
				taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings. They followed
				the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies. Very few of
				the C words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech. Any
				scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list
				devoted to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words
				occurring in the other lists. Only a very few words were common to all lists, and
				there was no vocabulary expressing the function of Science as a habit of mind, or a
				method of thought, irrespective of its particular branches. There was, indeed, no
				word for <span data-line="11638"></span>&#8216;_Science&#8217;<span
					data-line="11638"
				></span
				>, any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the
				word Ingsoc.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11641">
				<span data-line="11641"></span>From the foregoing account it will be seen that in
				Newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was
				well-nigh impossible. It was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude
				kind, a species of blasphemy. It would have been possible, for example, to say Big
				Brother is ungood. But this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a
				self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, because
				the necessary words were not available. Ideas inimical to Ingsoc could only be
				entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only be named in very broad terms
				which lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them
				in doing so. One could, in fact, only use Newspeak for unorthodox purposes by
				illegitimately translating some of the words back into Oldspeak. For example, All
				mans are equal was a possible Newspeak sentence, but only in the same sense in which
				All men are redhaired is a possible Oldspeak sentence. It did not contain a
				grammatical error, but it expressed a palpable untruth-i.e. that all men are of
				equal size, weight, or strength. The concept of political equality no longer
				existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word
				equal. In 1984, when Oldspeak was still the normal means of communication, the
				danger theoretically existed that in using Newspeak words one might remember their
				original meanings. In practice it was not difficult for any person well grounded in
				doublethink to avoid doing this, but within a couple of generations even the
				possibility of such a lapse would have vaished. A person growing up with Newspeak as
				his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning
				of <span data-line="11670"></span>&#8216;_politically equal&#8217;<span
					data-line="11670"
				></span
				>, or that free had once meant <span data-line="11671"></span>&#8216;_intellectually
				free&#8217;<span data-line="11671"></span>, than for instance, a person who had
				never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and
				rook. There would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to
				commit, simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable. And it was to
				be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of
				Newspeak would become more and more pronounced — its words growing fewer and fewer,
				their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of putting them to improper uses
				always diminishing.
			</p>
			<p class="p indent" data-line="11683">
				<span data-line="11683"></span>When Oldspeak had been once and for all superseded,
				the last link with the past would have been severed. History had already been
				rewritten, but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there,
				imperfectly censored, and so long as one retained one<span data-line="11687"></span
				>&#39;<span data-line="11687"></span>s knowledge of Oldspeak it was possible to read
				them. In the future such fragments, even if they chanced to survive, would be
				unintelligible and untranslatable. It was impossible to translate any passage of
				Oldspeak into Newspeak unless it either referred to some technical process or some
				very simple everyday action, or was already orthodox (goodthinkful would be the
				NewsPeak expression) in tendency. In practice this meant that no book written before
				approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole. Pre-revolutionary literature
				could only be subjected to ideological translation — that is, alteration in sense as
				well as language. Take for example the well-known passage from the Declaration of
				Independence:
			</p>
			<blockquote data-line="11701">
				<p class="p noindent" data-line="11701">
					<span data-line="11701"></span>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
					men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain
					inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
					happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among men,
					deriving their powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form
					of Government becomes destructive of those ends, it is the right of the People
					to alter or abolish it, and to institute new Government…
				</p>
				<p class="p indent" data-line="11711">
					<span data-line="11711"></span>It would have been quite impossible to render
					this into Newspeak while keeping to the sense of the original. The nearest one
					could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single
					word crimethink. A full translation could only be an ideological translation,
					whereby Jefferson<span data-line="11716"></span>&#39;<span
						data-line="11716"
					></span
					>s words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government.
				</p>
				<p class="p indent" data-line="11719">
					<span data-line="11719"></span>A good deal of the literature of the past was,
					indeed, already being transformed in this way. Considerations of prestige made
					it desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical figures, while at the
					same time bringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of Ingsoc.
					Various writers, such as Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Byron, Dickens, and some
					others were therefore in process of translation: when the task had been
					completed, their original writings, with all else that survived of the
					literature of the past, would be destroyed. These translations were a slow and
					difficult business, and it was not expected that they would be finished before
					the first or second decade of the twenty-first century. There were also large
					quantities of merely utilitarian literature — indispensable technical manuals,
					and the like — that had to be treated in the same way. It was chiefly in order
					to allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of
					Newspeak had been fixed for so late a date as 2050.
